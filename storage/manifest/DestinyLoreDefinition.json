Uldren moves with cold, vicious anger. War here in the Garden. Petty, detestable war, brought into this place by some blundering Cabal expedition. They deserved what they got. The Garden must be left to tend itself, mustn't it? It must be allowed to evolve its secret fruits\u2026\n\nThe terrain dips. The red flowers fade away to low, woven grasses. The wind whispers\u2026 soft words, sentences with just the beginnings of syntax, the cadence almost musical. \"Brain stain,\" Jolyon whispers, fearing infection by a contagious idea. \"We should\u2026\" But his voice trails off as Uldren pushes ahead, down into a low vale, slipping easily through tangled undergrowth. Vex. There are Vex here, dozens of Goblins and Minotaurs, still as statues and covered in moss, in a ring like some robotic henge. They are singing in faint, wraithlike notes of inhuman clarity. Uldren knows what this place must be.\n\nThe Cabal Legionary huddles behind a stone. Uldren creeps forward. By the time the wounded bellowing thing knows he's there, he has a knife pressed to its helmet, right above the cleft of its lips and the soft tissues below. \"Don't move,\" he says, in Ulurant. \"Don't speak. This knife is atom-sharp.\"\n\n\"I can tell,\" the Legionary grunts in its native tongue. \"It's roight up in me eyes. Practically shavin' me bristles.\"\n\n\"Do you know where you are?\"\n\n\"Just abou' the worst place anyone's ever gone?\"\n\n\"You say that because you can't smell the air,\" Uldren says. \"It's sweet. Like pollen and thunder. Why did you come here?\"\n\n\"Not by any chance of oir own, ser. The milk robots abducted us.\"\n\nThe whispers have taken on a soft hint of Ulurant grammar, confirming Uldren's suspicion. This is a place where abstract patterns war for survival, fighting to propagate themselves by preying on each other. The Vex are singing to see how the Garden changes their song, and even this conversation has fertilized the air. \"Why are they here? What do they want?\"\n\n\"They come 'ere to pray, ser. They're makin' vessels ou' of themselves. They're the wors' things ever to be, ser. They 'ate existence.\"\n\n\"How do you know this?\"\n\n\"Oh, frum the seeds, ser,\" the Legionary says. \"Do yeh see them?\" And without hesitation or second thought, he punches the emergency medic release on his helmet. The pressure seal breaks and a ring of black gel sprays out, hissing. The Legionary slumps over. His helmet tumbles into his broad lap.\n\nBeneath the layer of gel, the whole surface of his skull has the pitted texture of a strawberry. Thousands of tiny seeds glisten in the Cabal's flesh. Uldren brushes the skin in fascination.\n\n\"Uldren,\" Jolyon radios, \"I really don't like the expression on your face.\"\n\n\"This place has secrets,\" the prince murmurs back. The bone mic feels cold and inorganic, poorly mated to his flesh, compared to the warm, close-packed pits of the Legionary's deformed skull. \"So many secrets\u2026 They grew in him, Jolyon. The Garden grew its secrets in him.\"\n\n\"Who gives a rat?\" Jolyon snaps. \"Your Highness, we've got to get out of here. Before whatever happened to them happens to us too!\"\n\nHe's afraid of secrets, Uldren realizes. The unknown terrifies him. Which is very sensible. Very rational. The attitude of a good scout, a good soldier, a survivor.\n\nBut Uldren can't stop imagining how astonished Mara would be at this place. What if he could bring her here?

Huge wet fruits slapped against his shoulders and detonated in overripe pulp. Fruits shaped like heavy, swollen Ghosts. He was huddled with Jolyon beneath a thick cobweb, holding his breath, as they listened to voices argue just outside. His heartbeat\u2026 was it his heartbeat? Or another's?\n\nHe was in an apartment block. He remembers that. He was sitting in the laundry room, a place with a black-and-white checkered tile floor, watching his crows tumble over and over in the dryer, black feathers flurrying, beaks clacking. A big old female Cabal sat in the tub to his left, scrubbing her back with a wire brush. A Vex Goblin with the face of Alis Li in its stomach stood behind the counter, selling detergent. \"Uldren,\" she said, \"you've got a hole in you.\" The Cabal grunted in agreement. He looked down at himself and there was a hole in his hand, black and perfectly round. His dryer ran out of time, but his crows were still wet.\n\n\"Uldren.\" Mara, shaking him. She does not ordinarily touch anyone. \"Did you see the heart?\"\n\nIt seems the most natural thing in the world that a garden should have a heart. \"The Vex infest the place,\" he says. \"It gives them something they crave. It\u2026 grows them toward what they want to be.\"\n\n\"You didn't answer the question,\" Mara says coolly. It's a perfectly sensible observation. It's the strangest thing Uldren has ever heard her say.\n\n\"Whatever the heart of that place is,\" he says, pacing, \"it's a seed, I think, a seed left behind to grow. Like a\u2026 a node of Glimmer. Or\u2026\" The idea strikes him as a thunderbolt. \"Or a tripwire. Bait to attract those who seek out and destroy what they don't understand.\"\n\nBait for Guardians. Bait to mark some milestone in the Traveler's recovery.\n\n\"I told you never to go there,\" Mara says. Her eyes burn. She draws her cloak tight. \"Are you not devoted to me?\"\n\n\"Sister,\" he says, \"of course I am.\"\n\n\"Yet you defy me.\"\n\nYes, Uldren thinks. Yes, aren't those the same thing?

He didn't commend Jolyon to the Queen or throw him a fete for his bravery or even ask if he was sleeping all right after\u2026 after everything. He forgot about him.\n\n\"Hey,\" Jolyon says, not looking up. \"You weren't at the range yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't even need a spotter,\" Uldren says, trying to tease him. But it comes off flat and dismissive. \"I've been, uh.\" Dreaming. Recording his dreams. Poring feverishly through the Origin Libraries, searching for confirmation of what his heart wants so desperately to be true. The future of the Awoken could lie in that Garden. There is a wellspring of Light on Earth, a blinding beacon that will only grow brighter. The Awoken will not survive, not as they are; Mara's vision and the truth of their origins will be lost, diluted by the anodyne philosophy of those Cityborn ideologues. The Guardians will kill everything they find.\n\nWhat if the Garden is the Traveler's antithesis?

The profound truth of it hits him like a cold wind. \"You don't, do you?\" Jolyon knows exactly where he was born, to what lineage. His capabilities as a marksman are public record. As one of Uldren's Crows, he flies dangerous surveillance missions, but he is not a covert operative. Uldren knows\u2026 everything about him.\n\n\"You gonna be on the range tomorrow?\" Jolyon asks, too casually. \"Thought we might shoot a few magazines.\"\n\n\"Not tomorrow,\" Uldren says. \"I have work to do.\" He is already trying to imagine how Mara would react if he tries to turn the Oracle Engine on the Garden.

Shattered asteroids and cracked habitats spill bright flakes of debris. There is nothing quite so stark and brilliant as sunlit wreckage in vacuum.

As desperation took hold and the last of the Fallen raced across the stars in search of salvation, their dependence on machines evolved into a deep-rooted need\u2014their weapons to fight, their ships to fly, their Servitors to survive.\n\nThat need became worship. That worship became faith. And the Archons\u2014those who oversaw the care and consecration of the Servitors\u2014were looked upon to provide hope through their words, teachings, and interpretations of the machines' wants, needs\u2026 desires.\n\nBut Fikrul saw another path\u2014one that would later be mimicked and twisted by the techno-deviant Splicers in the Plaguelands of Earth while he and his explored their own darker interpretations of faith.\n\nFikrul is a Fanatic.\n\nScorned and abandoned.\n\nFikrul is all who strive to regain strength of self and purpose. He is a survivor.

They were not gods. They were tools. Instruments to be mastered and controlled and manipulated in service of Eliksni pride. None should grovel for Ether. None should have their honor bound to the whims of manufactured deities.\n\nBut the evolution of Fikrul's faith did not end there. If the machines\u2014the very things that had regulated the whole of their existence\u2014were tools, why not life itself?

Two allies driven by opposing forces\u2014one science and the unmaking of faith, the other rage and its relentless push to destroy.\n\nThere had long been tension between the two, as Reksis had, more than once, slipped into the Machinist's workshop to inflict himself on the Servitors caged there.\n\nFikrul, the Fanatic\u2014their spiritual leader and one-time Archon Priest\u2014watched patiently as their rivalry grew. He saw strength in their ire. He saw fire and fury, but also more\u2014a new path forward. One that could join their passions and drive them further\u2014a whole stronger than its warring parts.\n\nFikrul waited, biding time as tensions rose and threatened to splinter the Barons' loyalties. Only when Elykris could take no more, on a night when she caught the Hangman prepared to slaughter her latest haul of lesser Servitors, did Fikrul step in.\n\nFikrul motioned to Elykris and said, \"Bring me a Servitor.\" As Reksis hissed with anticipation, she hesitated, but Fikrul was patient. \"Where is your trust?\"\n\nElykris released a Servitor from its bondage.\n\nFikrul motioned the Servitor closer, then turned to Elykris. \"You have gathered many, Machinist. Hundreds. Maybe more. Our own supply\u2014our life force fed by slaved mechanics.\" Elykris nodded to the Servitor as it inched closer to the Archon's open arms\u2014welcoming the once revered orb as one would a child.\n\nThe other Barons began to bark, a rhythmic warriors' chant.\n\n\"For all the value in your work\u2026 it is not enough to feed ourselves.\" Fikrul hugged the Servitor. There was a tenderness to the embrace. A sorrow. \"We must also starve our enemies, as you were once starved.\" With a blur, Fikrul's lower arms unsheathed and triggered a pair of polished, sparking Shock Blades. \"As were we all.\"\n\nThe Servitor, still held with the clutches of the Archon's powerful upper arms, cried a shrill, digital wretch\u2014pain mixed with confusion as the blades carved its outer shell and plunged deep into the core of its systems. Ether hissed and sprayed.\n\nFikrul released the machine's silent shell, and it clanged lifeless to the ground. He turned to Elykris. \"Do you see?\" Elykris smiled. She was ever the brightest among them, though her focus could lose clarity when she became frenzied.\n\nThe Barons had long been trouble for the Awoken and Fallen of the Reef, but that trouble had been limited to hit-and-run tactics. What Fikrul had just presented was a new way.\n\nFikrul stepped to Reksis. \"Do you see?\" The brute barked in response, \"Kill them all!\"\n\nFikrul laughed. \"Not 'all,' Hangman. Just the ones we do not need.\" \n\nThe Barons cheered as Fikrul continued, \"Every Servitor\u2014any Servitor\u2014bound to a House is now a target. Until none remain but those upon whom we feed.\"","name":"A Scorned Path","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/d607917e27b5c55c2f73500c2502a1c9.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3293617211,"index":466,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3310394789":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"Don't fool yourself.

It speaks!\n\nSlowly, without breaking eye contact, she lays her other knife on the ground between them. The blade points toward her boots. He watches her every movement. How many secrets have the flesh-lovers betrayed, that this creature can make peace like a cringing drekh before his kel?\n\nShe taps two fingers against her cuirass. \"Sjur,\" she says slowly, then she points at him.\n\nHonor-bound even as he simmers in scandal, he replies, \"Misraaks.

Those who came arrived in the Gardens of Esila, and Azirim was the very last. Seeing him land, Esila said to him, \"Ah! You are bold. Do you truly think you've earned the right to revel in this place?\"\n\nAnd Azirim answering said, \"Please, wise lady. I've gone 'round the worlds and through the stars themselves. I have come only to congratulate your people. If you lend me your ear, I can prove I will not waste the mercy you might grant me.\"\n\nAnd Esila said to him, \"We've often lent our ear to your indiscretions. I know what happens to that which is lent to you. I need no assurance.\"\n\nAnd Azirim answering said, \"My indiscretions? Wise lady, I do admit, I may have whispered truths you gave me to deceive those who would deceive me. But have I ever struck out with hungry fang against your people? Have I set fire to your trust? I have seen the error of my ways. Let me prove to you oh how I have changed.\"\n\nAnd Esila, though she could see a flickering in Azirim's reflection, could not resist a redemption story. Esila cast forth her hand and beckoned to Azirim in mercy. And Esila said to him, \"Join us and be glad, but let me hear your testimony first.\"\n\nAnd so invited, Azirim bowed his crested head and hid a secret smile and spoke with the pardon Esila had given him. He recounted his many regrets in deceiving the kind merchants in the capital city of Interamnia. He recounted his charity to the wayfaring Corsairs who could not have escaped the heliopause without his aid. He recounted his journey to retrieve the eutech stolen from Pallas by the profane scavengers the Fallen, and he named his friends and those who had shown him kindness. And from the raucous parties beyond the lush gardens of Esila came an audience of Techeuns in training and flush-cheeked young Corsairs. They knelt in the dewy grass and they listened, and as they listened, and as Azirim spoke, his appetite grew and grew. Night fell on the Dreaming City.\n\nAnd Azirim said to those who knelt enraptured, \"Come, let me sing to you of extinction. Let me sing to you of lives lost in beautiful places, o audience mine. Sing with me, sing!\" He bade them rise, and led them singing down and away from the gardens of Esila. He spread his wings and flew out into the empty air beyond the steep cliffs that bordered the gardens. And to those who happened to glance toward the gardens from far-off pavilions, it seemed a merry parade, a joyous chorus.\n\nAnd they did not hear the singing stop.\n\nAnd they did not hear the bodies dashed against the shore below.\n\nAnd they did not see Azirim grow, or laugh, or flee.","name":"Azirim","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/57c8e5b0eaf344ca17453c2963e4ede2.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2176242262,"index":488,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2176242263":{"displayProperties":{"description":"$\n$ COPY BAMBERGA\"ORIN RCLJN3YJPYQ79YER\"::APHEL.REL   APHEL.REL\n$ TYPE APHEL.REL\n\n%%%%%%%%%%% VIOLET CLEARANCE ONLY %%%%%%%%%%%\n\nINDEX:\n\nEVENT 2PAL-A :: OTDR-4-REL\nEVENT 2PAL-B :: OTDR-4-REL\nEVENT 4VES-A :: OTDR-4-REL\nEVENT 4VES-B :: OTDR-4-REL\nEVENT 4VES-C :: OTDR-4-REL\nEVENT 4VES-D :: OTDR-4-REL\nEVENT 4VES-E :: OTDR-4-REL\nEVENT 7IRI-A :: OTDR-4-REL\n\nSUMMARY OF SBU APHELION INCIDENTS FOLLOWS BELOW.\n\n*** EVENT 2PAL-A :: OTDR-4-REL ***\n\nINFORMATION RECEIVED APR 09-18T02:29:45+00:00 FROM PALADIN NOLG, CONSIDERED SOBER, DEPENDABLE, NOT OF FANTASY.

She doesn't know whether she will fly away or drop dead. As the elevator descends, she looks left at Illyn and then right at Uldren. She shuffles in her gleaming formal armor. From exile as Tower emissary to THIS is incredible. Unbelievable. She does not deserve it. \"This is real,\" she whispers, unable to stop herself. Uldren smiles, but Illyn makes a warding gesture: Be silent!\n\nMusic begins to swell as the elevator settles. At the center of the room, the Paladins and the rest of Illyn's Techeuns are arrayed around Riven, of course, and\u2014\n\nHer breath catches. \n\nMara. \n\nShe can't help shooting another quick glance at Uldren: How..?\n\nHis smile widens.\n\nPetra sets her jaw, pulls her shoulders back, stands strong and tall.\n\nA chorus of thirty sings them into the Hall of Names. The air is sweet with lavender, and there are hundreds of candles lit all around the room, and even at this distance she can see Hallam is verklempt. This is as good a homecoming as she could ever imagine. More than she ever deserved.\n\nWhen they reach the dais, she kneels. Uldren and Illyn proceed past her so that they can acknowledge the Queen and her waiting counselors. The song ends; the music quells. Uldren and Illyn speak together, and their voices ring out fierce and true. \"Your Grace, we here present to you Petra Venj, your loyal servant, wherefore all you who are come this day to witness her homage and service. Do you acknowledge her?\"\n\nPetra cannot see anything but her own distorted reflection in her polished sabatons. She closes her eyes.\n\n\"I do,\" Mara says, and Petra's throat tightens.\n\nUldren and Illyn turn, synchronized. \"Petra Venj! Are you willing to take the oath?\"\n\n\"I am willing,\" Petra manages, struggling to steady her voice.\n\n\"Will you solemnly promise and swear to protect our people, our holdings, our territories, and our immaterial interests?\"\n\n\"I solemnly promise so to do.\"\n\n\"Will you to your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Will you, to the utmost of your power, uphold your sospital duties in defense of your Queen's life?

With this blade, do justice, stop the growth of inequity, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform the things that are amiss, and confirm the things that are in proper order: that doing these things you may embody my will and become my Wrath. May the hunt be good.\"\n\n\"May the hunt be good,\" echoes the assembly.\n\nPetra does not see the cynical glance that passes between Leona and Pavel, who have both served the Queen faithfully for decades.

She wets the pad of her thumb with the tip of her tongue, then uses the moisture to hold a bundle of fresh-picked asphodelia in place. She ties off the stems with a length of silk-spun gold thread, then begins the mindless busywork of braiding in all the expected accoutrements: a serrated fang, a shotgun shell, a cloudy amethyst crystal\u2026\n\nRiven turns to watch. On this day, her head is the size of a Fallen pike. She is vibrant blue with a yellow and red crest, and her pupils are crescents within her lidless eyes. After a time, she says, \"Madadh is dead but you make him no bouquet.\" \n\nMara looks up, struck by the novelty of the moment. She studies Riven, and swallows the first words that come to her tongue, which are, Madadh's bones are whispering at this very moment on Venus. Instead, she asks, \"You mourn him?\"\n\nThat crescent-pupil contracts as thin as a sickle's edge. \"No.\"\n\nHaving found the true answer, Mara resumes her work. A while passes in silence until she says, \"Ahamkara have no traditions.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No sentiment.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMara bites off a piece of thread. \"Why did you allow my brother to spirit you away?\"\n\n\"You know this truth, wise Queen.

When she finishes her memorial bouquet, she unfolds herself and rises to stretch. Riven does the same, and as she relaxes, she spreads and shuffles and shakes her pinions until they all lie straight.\n\nThe land around them is shapeless rock that will become an aubade to those left behind; Mara will honor her enemies and friends alike in stone, she will build grand cathedrals veneered in amethyst and agate.\n\nRiven butts her rounded snout under Mara's hand and waits.\n\n\"Let us find Kelda,\" Mara says.","name":"Riven","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/57c8e5b0eaf344ca17453c2963e4ede2.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2176242266,"index":492,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2176242267":{"displayProperties":{"description":"SHE HAS RUINED EVERYTHING!\n\nSuch blind arrogance\u2014\n\nWE ARE LOST!\n\nh u r r y\n\nHe will recruit them all if we do not act now\n\nW H A T C A N W E D O\n\nDone cannot be undone!

He had killed it twice in ambush, he said, to be certain it could not die. It had once been an Awoken man, and, recognizing it, Mara turned away from her plans for the Dreaming City and watched it coolly.\n\n\"It is a Guardian,\" she said. \"Once it was Chao Mu.\" He had left the Reef alone, knowing that he could never return or see his family again, to repair a failing climate controller in what had once been Earth's Gobi breadbasket. He had said he could not bear to watch the world wither.\n\n\"Bow before the Queen,\" Uldren said, giving him a shove.\n\nThe Awoken man looked at him, then back at Mara. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, bowing. \"My name is Savin.\"\n\n\"You do not remember your wives?\"\n\nHe did not.\n\n\"You do not remember your child, who is now a hundred and ten?\"\n\nHe did not.\n\n\"You do not remember your passion, which was the insulation of minutely sensitive detectors from all but the most specific and subtle radiations?\"\n\nHe did not, except that he said he could touch magnetic fields and loved to tweak the miniscule weave of the circuits in his robe. He had a zoogoer's enthusiasm for particle physics.\n\n\"To what do you owe your loyalty?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu said, \"my Ghost told me that I am a Guardian of the Traveler, reborn in its Light. I was not a day old when your brother waylaid me.\"\n\nAnd he caused to appear from his body a machine like a sphere cradled in a broken cube, which bobbed impertinently and blinked at the Queen. \"You'll make an enemy of the City and every Guardian in it if you keep us against our will,\" the machine warned them. \"But we would gladly be your allies, if you desire it. The City has no idea of your existence, except faint myths among the Awoken on Earth.\"\n\n\"Does it speak for you?\" the Queen challenged Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu.\n\n\"I speak for myself,\" Savin-who-was-Chao-Mu answered. \"Behold!\" And he drew forth from the quantum vacuum a shrieking singularity, which he held between his hands and then telescoped down into nothing.\n\n\"Are you intrinsically good?\" the Queen asked.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he answered. The Queen knew this was a lie or a misapprehension. She was aware of the Risen and the cruel fiefdoms they had sometimes enabled. However, perhaps the Ghosts that had made the Risen were destroyed or became enlightened.\n\nNow the Queen asked the Techeuns to assess the differences between the Chao Mu they remembered and this Savin returned as a Guardian of the Traveler, using their most sensitive physical and psychological tests. Most of all, though, the Queen was curious about the reaction of her Ahamkara, which had begun to salivate, and to assume a form more like the Guardian expected: monstrous and befanged.\n\nBut her brother whispered urgently to her, \"We must know how to kill it, Mara. There are more every day.\" \n\nSavin the Guardian showed a tremendous fondness for doing things; he had a pathologically task-oriented nature, which made him very useful to the Reef. Yet there was always the sense that his Ghost was watching, observing, reporting. And Savin was most of all greedy\u2014not in the grasping manner of the petty, but in an enormous, all-consuming way, for he desired materials and experiences that would temper him into a better Guardian, and he was always experimenting with his strange powers in foolish ways that left him briefly dead, seeking \"a new Super ability\" or \"some way to make my grenades faster.\" He grew tired of performing trivial tasks about the Reef, complaining that the dangerous repairs he made were endless and boring, and that he wanted to move on to new worlds. He leapt into space, repeatedly and without reason, as if his death were no more traumatic than a hop off a curb. Obsessed with reward and efficiency, he would rather do one profitable thing a thousand times than waste his efforts on a less beneficial novelty.\n\nBy the end of her acquaintance with Savin, Mara had decided she did not like this Traveler and what it did to people. Yet she had also decided that she felt a strange kinship and sympathy for it, this cornered, desperate god, making infinite sacrifices out of its people.\n\nPerhaps the Earth would be better off if the Traveler vanished or was destroyed, she thought. Even in the Reef, she felt as if she were living next to a torch held up in a dark wilderness, calling out across the galaxy to hungry things with too many eyes.","name":"Savin","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/57c8e5b0eaf344ca17453c2963e4ede2.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":2193019845,"index":494,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"412159069":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Secrets.

She looks down and kicks her legs.\n\nThe stars shine brilliant here, because the sun is only fractionally brighter than the rest of them. Sol lies almost perfectly below her. Of course up and down are defined only by the thrust axis of Yang Liwei. Upward, the black umbrella of the shield and the matter storage, and the docked ships which make Yang Liwei not just a mothership, but an entire traveling fleet. Down below, along the slim spine of the ship, the shielded bulb of the engine glows invisibly infrared. If she slips off this ledge, she will fall down the ship's length at one-third of an Earth gravity, not because there is anything pulling her, but because the ship is pulling away.\n\nYang Liwei is accelerating, slowly but inexorably, toward the stars.\n\nShe is of no single race or ancestry, and the light on her skin is the color of starlight: She drifts with her suit tinted clear so she can soak it up. She was nineteen years and nine months old at the moment the ship began its transtellar injection burn, although this is true only if you count by the calendar of a planet she has barely visited but will always love. She thinks you cannot help but love Earth if you grow up in space. You love Earth the way all adolescents secretly adore two-century-old video of nai nai and ye ye dancing on New Year's Eve. Earth does not ask too much. The colonies are demanding parents, but Earth is like a chill old grandam, simmering in weird art and weirder ideas, enthroned upon ecology older than Human time. Earth was the first terraformed world. Life made Earth livable.\n\nShe is going with Yang Liwei and the rest of Project Amrita to make new worlds.\n\nShe came because she saw an omen in a man's death. She was on EVA with him, repairing a jammed radiator fin on an uncrewed circum-Jovian platform. They worked in companionable silence, listening to the howl of the Jovian magnetosphere when it happened. A frozen rabbit embryo came out of deep space at forty kilometers per second and went through his faceplate. The rabbit must have been spilled in a biocontainer accident far from the sun to plunge back inward like a comet.\n\nImmediately afterward\u2014for reasons very clear to her because she has always had a sense for the meaning of things, reasons very difficult to explain to others because she has always felt this sense was secret\u2014she asked her mother if the family could travel with Project Amrita.\n\nAmrita: the drink that endeth drinking, the bottomless cup. It is the quest to spread far beyond the solar system and to end Human dependence on the Traveler. It calls to those who see Humanity as a cocoon, an instar, a form ready to be shed.\n\nShe is an Auturge 3rd Class, a self-motivating subsystem of the ship's inclusive ecology, a term that spans technology, biology, and behavior, all of which must be maintained for the mission to succeed. Her task is to locate problems and report them to an Auturge 2nd Class, who will give her the tools she needs to repair them. But she never speaks to her 2nd. She never tells anyone about the problems she finds. Instead she fixes them herself. Her work has therefore assumed a magical quality: She appears where there is trouble, and shortly afterward, the trouble goes away. People have begun to leave gifts for her. Some of these gifts are questions. She answers the questions with a quiet confidence some would argue she has not earned. She knows she sees more of their lives than they see of hers\u2014and that this mystery, this seeing-without-being-seen, grants her a kind of power that is like wisdom.\n\nShe lives outside the ship, suited and cocooned in a layer of cytogel, which keeps her surgically clean. She misses the wild zero-gravity fashions of her upbringing, clothes like drifting jellyfish that squirm away from snags, self-correcting darts in the fabric, silk like cool spilled alcohol. She misses the sense of oil and sweat on her skin, for the suit leaves her so clean that she feels skinned raw.\n\nStill, she stays out here because she wants to feel the changing taste of starlight as the universe ahead blue-shifts. As Yang Liwei accelerates toward lightspeed, it moves faster and faster into the light coming from ahead. If light were like dust, it would strike Yang faster, but light can never change speed, so it gains energy instead. Red light is low energy, and blue-violet light is high energy, so the universe becomes blue.\n\nEven now, the very tip of the visual spectrum, violet-blue light, is shifting up into invisible ultraviolet, the color of speed, the color of future.","name":"Brephos I","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":412159070,"index":496,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"412159071":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"Mara!\" the fighter shouts, delighted, and a punch shuts him concussively up.

It's the right move, but it doesn't matter. The woman groans, grays out, goes limp\u2014but Uldwyn can't get out from beneath her sheer inertia before he hits the killzone. The bell goes off. Uldwyn groans as his rail-hard body forcibly decelerates his opponent's entire mass. Events have built up momentum, and he is just in the way.\n\n\"What did you lose?\" Mara asks him.\n\nHe lies there panting and grinning, shedding perfectly round spheres of blood. \"It's good to see you inside. What brought you?\"\n\nShe and her fraternal twin never answer each other's questions directly. Mara is cool with this because she feels like words are a very bad system of encryption, and that if you really want to communicate with someone, you must develop your own special one-to-one cryptosystem. The ideal statement, Mara feels, would be indecipherable to anyone but the person it's spoken to\u2014and even then, only if they know you are the one speaking.\n\n\"I got you some pictures,\" she says, pushing the big woman off him, eliciting a fuzzy \"oh hi Mara.\" \"Full sensorium captures. You can trade them for the parts I need.\"\n\nUldwyn helps the big woman pull herself vertical, but his eyes are narrow on Mara. Not because he's sore at the idea of helping her\u2014he's always liked bartering, bargaining, the hustle\u2014but because he knows what kind of black market wants these captures. \"How far off the hull did you take them?\"\n\nHow far off? All the way off. They are in zero gravity because Yang Liwei shut off its engines for an inspection cycle. So while Uldwyn got in prize fights, Mara kicked off Yang Liwei's forward shield and coasted ten kilometers into pure void, tethered by only a thread-thin molecular line. She ordered her suit's cytogel to gather around her face. Then, only then, she overrode every sanity system in her softsuit and commanded it to retract into storage mode.\n\nThe suit peeled away like rind and she was drifting in hard vacuum.\n\nThe void boiled the water off her skin. Her body swelled with unchecked pressure until her undersuit forced it to stop. Alarmed cytogel crawled down her throat, hissing emergency oxygen: not enough. Her skin blued with cyanosis. She was bathed in the most profound emptiness.\n\nShe recorded all of it at the neural level. The exquisite darkness. The sense of fatal independence from all things. There are those who will give anything to feel that void.\n\n\"You can't keep doing this,\" Uldwyn complains, as the big woman stares at Mara in awe. \"Mom is going to die of worry.\"","name":"Brephos II","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":412159071,"index":497,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"412159064":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"I really don't care what risks you take,\" Mara's mother sighs. \"That's the deal we made, my little yellow star\u2014\"\n\n\"Mom!\" Mara protests.\n\n\"My discarded tube of sealant, my sweet little fleck of paint\u2014\"\n\nOsana likes to compare Mara to small pestilent items that drift near spacecraft, like crystals of frozen urine. As far as Mara can tell, Osana is the apex of a centuries-long project to create the ultimate embarrassing mom. She is also very blunt: \"Mara, even when you were little, you wanted me to treat you like an adult. So I have. But you remember what I told you, don't you? If you don't want to be my daughter, I can't watch over you like a mother would. I can't put you first, like a mother would. I will always be your friend, but I have to make my own choices too.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean you had to tell the Captain!\"\n\nThey walk shoulder-to-shoulder down the companionway to Captain Li's wardroom. Mara keeps trying to get a step ahead, to lead, but Osana somehow matches her every time. \"Of course I did,\" Osana says. \"You started a cult, Mara. If I didn't say something to the Captain, Behavior would've had this conversation with you instead. Do you want that?\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything. People liked my captures. People left me presents, spare parts, tips\u2014then Uldwyn got into it, you know how he is\u2014\"\n\n\"Don't!\" Osana wheels on her. \"For shame, Mara. You know your brother will follow anywhere you lead. You know he's not capable of the same, ah,\" her lips twitch, \"imperial remove. You knew he'd brag about you living on the hull\u2014and you let him do it. It is one thing to have a particular power over people, Mara. But it is another to deny that you are using it.\"\n\nMara thinks she can come up with a stinging retort, given a few more paces, but it's too late. The hatch to Captain Li's wardroom swings open. Mara is terrified of this place. This is where Captain Alice Li, divine presence in Mara's life, interfaces with the officers who are the manifestations of her will. Since Mara wants to be Alice Li someday, the wardroom makes Mara feel like she is an usurper princess scoping out her rival's court.\n\nCaptain Li offers them tea. Mara cannot imagine the ways in which she is butchering what must be an intricate and meaningful tea ceremony. Li serves some very battered pre-Traveler ceramic sloshing with hot green tea, then immediately adulterates her own cup with milk from the Cow Thing on the biodeck.\n\n\"Revolting, isn't it?\" She smiles at Mara's bewildered horror. \"You should've seen what I put in my tea when I was camping in Mongolia. I understand your colleague, who is also your mother, has some concerns about your relationship with the rest of the crew?\"\n\n\"My darling Mara,\" Osana says, \"has\u2014entirely by accident, I'm sure\u2014cultivated a reputation as a minor divinity. Her captures from outside the ship are hot items for barter. People draw fan art. There are\u2026 tips left for her.\"\n\n\"You take captures while EVA, sometimes without a suit?\" Li nods. \"Yes, I've played one. A remarkable sensation.\" This makes Mara grin impetuously. \"Mara, you are an Auturge, a volunteer. I cannot order you to stop, and your work is exemplary. Are you putting anyone else in danger with your\u2026 art projects?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"Just myself.\"\n\n\"False!\" Li barks. \"That is a selfish answer. You are now a symbol to my crew, a house god. If you were to die, they would lose something important, something Human that they have created out of loneliness and void. It would be an unforgettable reminder of the hostile nothingness that surrounds us. When you endanger yourself, you endanger that symbol. You are part of this mission's behavioral armor, Mara.\"\n\nMara is thunderstruck. She's never thought about it this way. \"All I did was take some captures. I didn't ask to be anyone's\u2026 mascot.\"\n\n\"You presented yourself as a conduit to secret knowledge,\" Captain Li counters. \"People made something out of you, Mara. Please take this from a starship captain: What people make of you, what they create of you\u2014even without your consent\u2014becomes a kind of responsibility. If the Mara they see when they look at you is good for them, then you have some duty to be that Mara.\" She looks to Osana. \"What about your boy? He's in medical more often than any of the other underground fighters.\"\n\nIt does not surprise Mara that Captain Li knows about the fights. \"My son,\" Osana says, \"is determined to be his own worst enemy. Thank you for taking the time to speak to us.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Li studies them coolly. \"I keep an ear out for\u2026 curious personalities.

A rumble and a thrum down in her gut, in her marrow, in the lowest, basest elements of her body. It is the vibration, the sound of the very fabric of her being scrunching up and stretching out; the distance between the atoms of her body collapses, then expands. The cycle repeats again and again. For a moment, she feels her fingertips and toes pulled away from her core, yanked by tidal forces. It feels like the lowest rumble of the biggest subwoofer ever built. It sounds like the deep voice of God whispering ASMR directly into her ear. It tingles, it thrills, and it leaves in its wake a subsonic tint of dread and anticipation.\n\nShe shivers. \"Gravity wave,\" she says. \"Talk to me, Geode.\"\n\nThe Space-Time Geodesics Officer looks like she's just been hand-delivered a Nobel. \"This is amazing!\" she crows, fully aware that she and everyone else are about to die, but transported away from such temporal concerns by scientific rapture. \"Can you feel that growl? We're experiencing high-frequency, high-amplitude gravity waves. Phaeton strikes. Axions decaying through the hull. Sterile neutrinos. It's all coming from a source at bearing, uh, zero four five mark zero three zero relative, range\u2014range highly variable.\"\n\nAnother wave tears through Yang Liwei. Everything in the ship simultaneously compresses and stretches as the gravity wave deforms the space-time metric. \"Is it the phantom?\" Li demands, as her ship thrums subsonically. \"Is that phantom ship emitting these waves?\"\n\n\"I have no idea!\" GEOD says, exultantly. \"None of this makes any sense at all! Wow!\"\n\nAlice Li has the distinct sense that something ancient and malevolent is operating upon them: a trillion-fingered hand reaching in to caress the very atoms of their being, setting protons a-spin, strumming nerves like guitar strings. A tongue with ten billion slithering forks tasting the surface of their brains. The sense of imminent doom crescendos. She knows, absolutely and utterly, that what is about to happen to her and to her crew is far worse than death. The darkness knows them now. The thing that has come to kill Humanity has their taste.\n\n\"INCO.\" She clings to her restraint harness as the ship growls through another wave. Her bones creak as they stretch. \"Last report on the Traveler? Any sign of an intervention?\"\n\n\"It was at Earth, Captain, and there were high-yield weapon discharges all over the signal.

She cannot surrender her mystery.\n\nSo she kicks off the hull on fifty kilometers of tether.\n\nBut there's no starlight to die in. The darkness is absolute. Gravity waves tug on her line, pulling her back toward Yang and then hurling her away. In time, she feels another vibration in the line. \"Sister,\" the tether transmits. \"I'm coming out to get you.\"\n\nBrother, she thinks, you'll lose yourself trying to follow me.\n\nCaptain Li's voice breaks through the static, drawn out to a mumble and then compressed to a shriek. Spikes of hard radiation go through her words like bullets, spattering phonemes into eerie compression artifacts. \"This is the interstellar vessel Yang Liwei to the entity interacting with us. We are not involved in your dispute with the powers around this star. We are on a mission to begin a new life elsewhere. Our purpose is orthogonal to yours.

She holds it in one hand and reaches out with the other, gripping the emptiness, feeling how the tides of broken space pull at her fingertips. She senses that the nothingness around her is not indifferent; that it is aware of all purposes, and that its own purpose encompasses them. It is infinitely hostile because it must be.\n\nSuddenly, as if the void around her has just spontaneously Big Banged, she sees light.\n\nA point of pure white shines in the cosmic distance. Not just visible luminance\u2014her suit decomposes the spectrum\u2014but light in the radio bands, in microwave, keening ultraviolet, a spike of gamma, a total and all-embracing radiation. It sings. It chatters. It speaks in a voice older than suns. She feels that she could Fourier the voice for a century and never decompose it into its parts. It is awesome and appalling and piercingly true. Mara understands how those who die in radiation accidents must feel: A single flash of invisible power sears away all possible futures except one. She feels her soul itself has been ionized, blasted into a higher energy state.\n\nThe light pierces the darkness. Not like the sunrise, not like a wall or a flood, but a single crepuscular ray\u2014a finger of radiance that reaches out through deepest night to touch her. It illuminates Mara, Uldwyn, and Yang Liwei.\n\nIt is not quite enough. It cannot vanquish the shadow.\n\nThus Mara finds herself drifting on the edge of the Light and the Darkness, on the dusk-and-dawn gradient between the two.\n\nShe feels a contest. A battle fought, an equilibrium reached: not a truce, but an infinite limit, like an equation dividing by zero, a collision of two violent eternities. Mara queries Yang Liwei for telemetry and her sensorium fills with the terrified scream of gravitational instruments. She howls too, a feral sound, ecstatic and lost: a wolf baying at the stars. She knows what's happening. Too much power has gathered here. The universe is appalled by the paradox. Nothing that has glimpsed this collision of infinitudes can be allowed to escape. The cosmos must censor its embarrassment. It must sequester the anomaly.\n\nThe slope of warped space-time around them has become too steep, and now every path outward or forward bends back to the center where Light and Dark collide. The definition of \"future\" has become synonymous with the definition of \"inward.\" This is why it's called an event horizon: For an object within the horizon, the path of all future things that can be done or seen leads inevitably down to the center. All events lead inward.\n\nA singularity is forming around her. A kugelblitz: a black hole created by the concentration of raw energy.\n\n\"Mara!\" Uldwyn shouts. \"Mara, you're too far out!\"\n\nMara thinks of her mother's face. She hears Osana say: I can't watch over you like a mother would. I have to make my own choices now.\n\nShe fires the detach command into the tether.\n\nGravity seizes her.

Here was undertaken the first census, which counted thirty thousand one hundred eleven women, ten thousand two hundred ninety five men, and four hundred eighty five otherwise. A fear arose among the awoken that the men and otherwise would be lost.\n\nAlis Li spoke first in council, but at the urging of Uldren, many sought out Mara for secret conclave. Among these were Kelda Wadj, who would be the Allteacher, and Sila, who would be mother of Esila.\n\nSayeth Alis, \"We were granted this world by a covenant with high powers, and in that covenant, we yielded our claim to our history. We abandoned what came before, but in doing so, we cast off all our debts. Look forward! Let us explore this infant cosmos, and revel in its glories!\"\n\nAgainst her spoke Owome An, who was of the forty thousand. \"We are alien here,\" said Owome. \"We must climb up our worldline, back to the place from which we came. I call for a vote.\"\n\nSayeth Mara, in secret, \"I think that we came here as safe harbor, and we cannot forever remain. I remember the danger was appalling. I remember we were born in death. I think we must gather ourselves carefully until the time is right.\"\n\nFrom this council, there arose eight verdicts and a ninth.\n\nFirst, that the people were Awoken, and they were immortal.\n\nSecond, that this world was Tributary of another, but that it was forbidden to seek any way to rejoin the mother stream. For this reason, it would be called the Distributary, for that was the proper name for a river that branches from the mother and does not return.\n\nThird, that the Awoken should multiply in wombs of flesh and machine, but only after the most careful forecast of population and ecology, and only under the supervision of those who knew the good technology; for each new child would be immortal.\n\nFourth, that those wise in the good technology should be heralded and heeded, so that the eu-technology could be preserved. They would be eutechs.\n\nFifth, that the women should hold care and protection of the men and the others until more could be born.\n\nSixth, that the purpose of the Awoken should be to know and love the cosmos.\n\nSeventh, that the Awoken were created out of covenant with Light and Darkness, but the covenant was complete, and no further debt would ever be called, except the duty of the Second Verdict to remain on the Distributary.\n\nEighth, that the Awoken were whole in themselves, and they existed in balance.\n\nNinth, that there would be no vote, but instead Alis Li would be recognized as Queen. Her first pronunciation was that there would be no secrets among Awoken.\n\nFor Alis knew of the quiet council around Mara, and although she was neither jealous nor afraid, she remembered it carefully as a spark that might catch.","name":"Ecstasiate III","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936654,"index":505,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"428936653":{"displayProperties":{"description":"In those days, there was a great birth of adventure among the Awoken. Hunters and pioneers sought the shape of the world, sailors charted the skein of rivers and the perimeter of seas, and astronomers plotted the motion of the crowded heavens. Over this age ruled Queen Alis Li, whose work was the creation of agriculture and the preservation of the eutechnology that she deciphered from the Shipspire.\n\nBut there remained in the forests many tribes of huntresses who preferred their lightfooted freedom-from-comfort-and-duty to the painstaking surplus of the city. Among these tribes, Mara lived with her brother\u2014whose name had returned as Uldren\u2014and with Osana, their mother. It is said that Osana lived as a negotiator and that her son brought her news from other tribes, for he was a scout and hunter of renown. Mara dwelt alone on a mountaintop.\n\nIn the tribes of the forests and the sea, there was the belief that the Awoken had been made out of a friction between contesting forces and that one day this conflict would need to be resolved. These were the Eccaleists who preached that Awoken owed a debt to the cosmos.\n\nIn the cities, however, they lived by the Seventh Verdict under their Queen, and they said the Awoken had been created by cosmic gift and carried neither responsibility nor eschaton. These were the Sanguine, who preached that the Awoken were as stable as an atom of carbon.\n\nNow there arose among the Eccaleists a woman out of the eight hundred ninety one who called herself the Diasyrm. She went into the cities, calling out, \"I accuse the Queen of deicide!\" When she was questioned, she spoke of a foundational crime.\n\n\"Alis Li was the first to awaken in this world,\" the Diasyrm preached. \"She set the terms of our existence. We could have been gods free of want or suffering. Instead, Alis Li chose our mortal form. Our Queen is complicit in all the pain we experience! The Queen murdered all our unborn godheads!\"\n\nAt the thought that the Queen Without Secrets had kept this most appalling secret to herself, the Sanguine cityfolk were deeply troubled.

The voices of the Paladins rise on summer wind, first choral, then the single keening strains of grief-paeans sung by lovers and close friends. They are singing their lost comrades into death. One of the 891 fell today, shot down by a matter laser, a coherent boson weapon: There was almost nothing left to burn. Matter lasers are the kind of appalling maltech weapon Alis thought she'd locked up in the Shipspire's vaults. She'd armed a few of her Paladins with them, just a few\u2014women she couldn't bear to lose\u2026\n\nThe thought that one might have defected to the Diasyrm breaks her heart.\n\n\"It wasn't supposed to go this way,\" Alis repeats. She has not had a confidante in nigh on fifty years: There is no one to whom she can show any doubt. \"I promise you it wasn't.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mara says. The eutechs found her and plucked her from her mountaintop with one of the Shipspire's VTOL aircraft, which Alis had, until the war, only ever used as an ambulance.\n\n\"The mission was to carry on the Human journey in a new world.\" Alis paces the wooden deck that clings to the Shipspire airlock, nearly a kilometer above the lake. \"To build a better society, on the principles of equality, knowledge, and peace. I have the charter, Mara. It remembers what I cannot. We were never meant to give up our bodies or shine like stars or\u2014or\u2014\" She groans in frustration and clutches the railing. \"Or whatever it is that the Diasyrm thinks I denied them.\"\n\n\"She thinks you denied them even the capability to imagine godhood.\"\n\nAlis looks sharply back at the other woman. \"Did you start this, Mara?\"\n\n\"Nothing has one beginning,\" Mara says.\n\n\"Did she come to you on your mountaintop and ask you what I did? Did you answer her? Is that why she's so convinced I,\" she swallows against the bitter taste of her enemy's words, \"enslaved her in mere Humanity?\"\n\n\"I didn't have to tell her.\" Mara's white hair stirs in the hot wind. A herd of black horses crosses the northern horizon, all born of Shipspire's wombs: chased by a long-legged huntress and her collie. \"You don't keep enough secrets, your Majesty. The Diasyrm might have opened any one of your texts and read the story you tell. \"We were born when a great ship fell into a pearl of shattered space. I awoke first, and in my awakening I collapsed the potential of the void into a form I understood\u2026\" Who can read that truth and not hear arrogance?\"\n\nAlis thought Mara might say that. Alis also thought Mara might try to push her off the balcony, but she now knows that was a petty fear. Mara is not the Diasyrm: Mara knows the unthinkable value of even a single Awoken life.\n\n\"Why do you love lies so much?\" she asks Mara.\n\n\"Not lies.\" The pale radiance of Mara's eyes; the flush of violet stain around them. \"Secrets. Even if everyone shared a single truth, all our minds would produce different versions of the truth. We speak these subtruths, and like flowers of different seed, the subtruths compete for the light of our attention. In time, only the fiercest and most provocative strains remain. They are not always the truest. Better to keep secrets, your Majesty. Better to tend a great mystery, and so starve the flowers before they can grow. That is how I would be Queen.\"\n\nBelow, the Lake of Leaves shimmers in the crater carved by Shipspire's mushroom prow. One by one, the funeral boats are going out.\n\n\"I want to end this war,\" Alis Li tells the second Awoken. \"I want to negotiate peace. I need your mother's help.

An immortal's grief and murder-guilt, left untended, will never fade. Thus it became known to those who fought in the Theodicy War that they had committed an incomparable evil. However, they could not confront their own responsibility, so they rose up in wrath against those who had given them cause, whether by caging them in flesh bodies or by drawing blood over grievance. The war continued by spear and bow, by knife and scalpel, by old machine and new invention. Ever did the Diasyrm's faithful call for the unawaring of Queen Alis Li.\n\nNow there entered into the Diasyrm's camp Osana, mother of Mara, famed for her skill in negotiating contested land. She had come with her son Uldren, who could win a place in any camp for his beauty and for the regal crow-eagle that alighted on his shoulder.\n\n\"I come from Mara,\" said Osana, \"whose heart has frozen in her chest. If you will end the killing, she will tell you any secret that you desire.\"\n\nFor his part, Uldren went among the Diasyrm's warriors and spread ill tidings of Mara's knowledge, saying, \"Mara remembers how the Queen led us here out of chaos and saved us from the twin blindness of darkness and light. Mara knows what the Queen keeps secret. Mara has seen the strife in our souls, the clash from which we were made. We could not ever have been gods with this flaw in us! Rather, we were made from this schism. For as all life is born from energy gradient, as life in the World Before was born from the gradient between hot proton-rich ventwater and cold seawater, we were born of the shadowline at the edge of Light and Dark. We are tremors in that fault. Forever will that schism lead us.\"\n\nHearing this new heresy, the Eccaleists were seized with rapture and scattered to the points of the compass, telling all they met, \"We are the yield of a mighty engine! We could never have been gods! Like diamonds, we were crushed into being. Like diamonds, we hold flaws.\"\n\nMeanwhile Osana spoke to the Diasyrm, who was also heartsick from the killing, and who longed to withdraw from the world and seek transcendence within. \"There is no weregild for the murder of an immortal,\" Osana counseled her. \"You must become a teacher or a midwife and devote yourself to the enrichment of new lives.\"\n\nBut the Diasyrm craved secret knowledge, and she sought Mara upon the mountaintop. Here, she vanished. If she was ever known again, it was not by the name Diasyrm.\n\nWhen there was peace, Queen Li ruled the Awoken for a time; however, the guilt of the war lay heavy upon her, and after an age of peace and progress, she abdicated to a new Queen.","name":"Fideicide III","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936651,"index":508,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"428936650":{"displayProperties":{"description":"A woman lives alone on the forest hills above the Feather Barrens. North of her, in a chaos of ravines and clear but fiercely radioactive streams, the hills surrender to high imperial mountains engaged in brutal seismic warfare, for the Distributary is a young world and has not settled its grudges. To the south are the dry lands where the birds of the forest, especially the parrots, go to die. She lives here because one day she will no longer be immortal, and she wants to observe the dignity of death.\n\nUp these hills comes a man and his mother. The man moves with practiced wariness. But his mother is tired of walking, so she sits down on a giant melon and bellows, \"MARAAA!\"\n\nA fountain of startled birds shoots up into the dawnlight. Not far away, the woman looks up from the broken body of a juvenile gray parrot and softly says, \"Mom?\"\n\nThat night over the fire, after Mara and Osana talk around the oddness of long separation, Mara, tending the pheasants on their spits, says, \"Brother, your eagle killed a parrot today.\"\n\n\"He had to hunt,\" Uldren says, carefully. \"You won't forbid him his last pleasures, will you?\"\n\n\"You've brought him here to die?\" Mara wants to leap up and hug her brother, out of pity and respect. Many of his raptors have died before this one, but Uldren has always been grief-stricken and furious at the waste. Now he's accepted what must happen; he has given his bird the respect of choosing its own place and time to pass.\n\n\"I have,\" Uldren says, looking away. Her pride and respect make him a little verklempt. \"Mother decided she would come along.\"\n\nA shear force as powerful as tectonics has divided Mara's heart. She wants to sit down with her mother and ask her everything, but she is afraid of Osana's insight. \"What brings you to my little camp, Mother?\"\n\n\"Lies,\" Osana says. \"Lies and secrets. And the girl who didn't want to be my daughter, who doesn't know the difference between them.\"\n\n\"I know the difference between a girl and a daughter,\" Mara says, purposefully misunderstanding. The drip pan sizzles beneath golden meat. Her stomach growls. \"Your daughter picks up your baton at the end of the race, and goes on living the life you've taught her. You wouldn't want that, Mother. Because then I'd be all your fault.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Osana sighs, \"but you know what I meant.\"\n\nUldren looks between the two of them, frowning. \"Mom, what's this?\"\n\n\"It's your sister about to admit she's behind it all. Aren't you, Mara?\"\n\nShe unimpales the pheasants from the spits and neatly licks hot grease off her hands. If she spoke, she might scream in terror. What does that mean, behind it all? Does Osana know?\n\n\"The Eccaleists are her creation,\" her mother tells her brother. \"The Diasyrm was her pawn. She allowed the Theodisy War because she was afraid we'd be too comfortable here\u2014also so Queen Alis would need her help politically. Mara couldn't afford to be the most radical dissident. She had to seem moderate for her beliefs to thrive. Isn't that right, Mara?\"\n\nMara puts a hand into the warm soil to keep herself from slumping in relief. Mother doesn't know it all. \"Shall I carve your portions?\" she asks, holding the fractal knife blade-down.\n\nUldren has that look. He knows Mara never answers his questions directly; by evading Osana's, it's as if she's saying that the question is really Uldren's to ask. \"Looks delicious. But Mother does make me curious. Why have you always lived away from the rest of us, Mara? The mountaintop, I understood. You had a brand new night sky to chart. But why now? Why go into the woods like a\u2026 a hermit? A heretic?\"\n\nFor the same reason she lived on the hull. For the same reason she can never allow Uldren to really reach her. There is power in remove and safety from the belittling politics of temporal power, which reveal the mighty as unforgivably ordinary and petty. The Awoken have a Queen because a Queen can be a mystery.\n\n\"I remember the day I was born,\" she says. \"Do you, Brother?\"\n\nHe flinches from her eyes. He remembers Yang Liwei and the tether into darkness. He remembers how gravity stretched them into agonized ribbons of flesh. He remembers the truth not even Alis Li may be allowed to know; Mara sees the agonizing moment, the cyclic revelation, when he thinks of her crime, allows it to pierce him like a spit, and buries it deep again.\n\nOsana takes her portion of pheasant meat and rolls it in the bowl of sweet cooked nuts her daughter has prepared. The stars are coming out over the mountains, and the forest birds sing. \"This place is good,\" she says. \"This world. Whatever you remember of our lives before, Mara\u2026 I know they cannot have been this good.\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"But you were both with me. I hope you always will be.\"\n\n\"Always,\" her brother promises.\n\n\"Eat well.\" Mara claps her hands and stands. \"Tomorrow we journey.\"\n\n\"Where?\" her mother asks.\n\n\"I have star charts to share.\" And heresies to tend to.

These were the Gensym Scribes, who traced their origin to Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, but who were in fact descendants of a band of roving storytellers who traveled across the immense salt glades in a hollering convoy of airboats. Here was their praise of the world:\n\nIt is sweet-watered, and there are no poisons upon it. The temper of the climate is even. Great broad-pawed cats stalk the shallow glades, and brilliant blue flamingos promenade upon the flats. The air is thick and warm, suited for flight, and the wind tastes of forest. No dawn has ever been as glorious as the salt glade dawn, and no dusk has ever moved women to weep as deeply as sunset in the Chriseiads. Corsairs sport upon the open seas, and where they waylay freighters rather than each other, they give rumor and assistance to their prey in proportion to the quality of the chase. Beloved are the stories of young lads and lasses who leap across to the corsair ship for a life of adventure! Beloved also are the terraced farms of the Andalayas, mountains so mighty and so dense with radioactives that they subside year by year into the crust. Most beloved are the fissioneers, who vaulted us to power on a world without petrochemicals. May they forgive the many stories of horror we have told in their memory. May they in particular forgive the lurid stories of the molten lead reactor, and the twelve who were impaled to the ceiling by their control rods, and the Core That Stalked.\n\nIt is the Sanguine Truth that we were granted this world by the unconditional mercy of the powers, and that we will never again know fear.\n\nHowever, the Scribes also recorded their frustration with Mara and Uldren, who alone out of the eight hundred ninety one were said to have seen creation from outside. These two wandered the land gathering lore of portents and prophecies, and all the Eccaleists who remained from ancient days whispered that soon the day of reckoning would be known\u2014the day when the Awoken would be called to repay their debt.\n\nNow in the court of one of the Scribes, there appeared a woman of stellar height and furious wrath, armed with a bow that could be strung only if she twined it around her body and used her whole mass to bend it. \"I am Sjur Eido,\" said the woman, \"and I accuse Mara of the ancient murder of my lady the Diasyrm. In my saddle, I have a weapon with only one death remaining. Take me to Mara, and I will deliver it.\"\n\nThe Scribes consulted and said to each other that this foul murder might prevent another Theodicy War. So they gave Sjur Eido all their knowledge to hunt Mara.","name":"Imponent I","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936649,"index":510,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"428936648":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Carefully, the people of the Distributary grew in number.

Those who do not die are as malleable and passionate as the young, as tempered and constant as the mature, and as wise and humble as the best of the old.\n\nBut as ever, the Awoken were troubled by death. It was easy to imagine a world older and harsher than the Distributary, a world crowded with competitors where the slow-changing and lushly alive Awoken would be helpless beside austere mayfly-quick breeders who adapted with every swift generation.\n\nWhy had the Awoken been spared mortality? Were they, as the Sanguine preached, rewarded for their bravery and fidelity in a past existence? Or were the Eccaleists right? Could all the gifts of the Distributary, all the milk-bright stars above, all the years of Awoken life, be a form of cowardice? Was there an unfought battle down in the center of the Awoken soul? A duty yet to be discharged?\n\nQueen Nguya Pin restored the monarchy to prominence over the Gensym Scribes. This she accomplished after a fateful visit, upon the day of the summer solstice, by a hooded and masked woman who some whispered was Mara Sov and others, the long-vanished Diasyrm. For nine and ninety years (a rhetorical figure meaning a long time), the Queen had been an authority only in the arts and matters spiritual. However, Queen Nguya Pin declared she was now an avowed Eccaleist and that the Queen would lead the quest to identify whatever debt the Awoken owed the cosmos. It was time to pursue a dream beloved to all Awoken: the conquest of space and the assessment of the true shape and age of their universe.\n\nThe ancient court of the Queen gave the Gensym Scribes a place to lay down their pride and act as equals. Soon the greatest engineers in the world assembled in the Queen's court, and whatever wealth or resources they required flowed freely. Great cataracts of men and women spilled around the palace screaming of ramjets and apoapses deep into the night, then awakening to pots of thick black coffee to mumble about metric tensors and cosmic microwave anisotropy.\n\nInto this feast of ideas came Sjur Eido, searching for the woman who had turned Queen Pin to Eccaleism. Sjur smoldered with an ancient fury, for another thing that the immortal may nurture is everlasting vendetta.\n\nSjur Eido deduced who among the Queen's court must be a disguised Mara Sov. She followed the hooded figure to her laboratory and watched Mara go to work soldering a makeshift bolometer to search for signs of primordial gravity waves. Sjur Eido's fury and grief whetted themselves against Mara's thoughtless grace and ancient beauty, until at last her heart unseamed itself and spilled its hot blood in a shout. \"Mara Sov!\" she cried, throwing down her maltech matter laser between them. \"I cannot live while you live, but I cannot bear to kill you. I challenge you to a duel to the agony. I will fight your most beloved companion to the death and leave you forever maimed or else die in the attempt.\"\n\nMara could not refuse this challenge. She summoned Uldren, and with a ruthlessness she was no longer frightened to wield, she told Uldren that he would stand for her in battle to the death against Sjur Eido.\n\n\"We cannot put it all upon a single fight,\" Uldren said to the ancient vendetta-bearer. \"Too much would be left to chance. Such an old grudge deserves to be tested well. I propose we fight with blade, with rifle, and with fifth-generation air superiority fighters.\"\n\nSjur Eido accepted these terms.","name":"Imponent II","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936648,"index":511,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"428936647":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Now it came to pass that Esila, daughter of Sila, recognized the scent of Sjur Eido, for smell lies deepest in memory.

While Queen Pin pondered how to honor this visitor\u2014and simmered over the insult of Sjur's unannounced presence\u2014a spy brought word of Sjur Eido's intentions to the Gensym Scribes.\n\nThe many Scribes were troubled by this news, for they had given Sjur Eido license to hunt and kill Mara Sov. If Sjur Eido murdered a guest of the Queen under the Scribes' remit, it would mean war and the end of the great Awoken push for space. Historians were called to the court with bouquets of sweet flowers and grant money to speak of Sjur Eido. \"She was one of Queen Alis Li's Paladins, but she was an Eccaleist, who believed that we would one day be called to repay the gift of our awakening.\"\n\n\"Would she defy the Queen's protection and murder a guest of the court?\" the Scribes asked.\n\n\"Oh, absolutely,\" the historians said, laughing. \"She was a terror.\"\n\nThe Scribes began preparations to flee the Queen's court, as they foresaw Sjur Eido's victory would be blamed on them. Sensing uncertainty, many vital contractors and suppliers withdrew from the space program. The Queen denounced the Gensym Scribes as faithless and selfish, and her Eccaleist followers bristled in rage against the Sanguine majority who had scuttled their dream of flight. Household turned against household, sister against brother, wife against wife. The whole world clenched her fists.\n\nMeanwhile, Sjur Eido and Uldren met each other on a net of woven lianas over a pool of heavy water. The light of the Queen's reactors shimmered beneath them as they took their places. Uldren wore a white chestpiece of ceramic armor over a suit of black tasseled silk, and he wielded a long fractal knife whose cutting edge was nearly three times as long as the blade. Sjur Eido fought in the contoured blue-gray pressure armor of a Paladin with the Star of Eight Edicts blazoned on her chest.\n\nBefore they began, Sjur Eido tore away the sheer curtain over the gardener's nook and looked in on Mara Sov. \"Are you afraid?\" she whispered, half in hatred, half in admiration, all in awe. \"Do you sweat? Does your breath come short?\"\n\nMara pressed her hand to Sjur's faceplate and left no stain. She held Sjur's gauntlet to her heart so Sjur could feel her steady pulse and even breath. \"You don't care about him?\" Sjur pressed her. \"It would mean nothing if I maimed him?\"\n\n\"You ask the right questions,\" Mara said, \"but of the wrong sibling.\"\n\nThen Sjur understood that she fought a man who would always express his love through loss and ordeal.\n\nShe bowed to Uldren and drew her knife. Uldren bowed in mocking reply. They fought across the web of lianas in a slow spiral, creeping like spiders, waiting for the motion of the web beneath them to signal an instant of vulnerability. Then the pounce, the clash, the blur of knives: Sjur Eido's straightforward prisonyard jabs against Uldren's whirling deceptive theater. All of knife fighting is in the seizure and surrender of space: Neither would surrender to the close, the clinch, the berserk adrenaline-sick exchange of thrusts that would leave both dead.\n\nUldren began to cut away key lianas to throw Sjur Eido's footing, and Sjur Eido countered by charging him to keep him off balance. At last, they fell together into the coolant pond.

For six weeks, they stalked each other as the political situation grew more dire. He was the better hunter, stealthier in motion and at ease in the wilderness, but Sjur Eido was the better soldier. She had no respect for the systems of the jungle, and she knew how to use that to her advantage. She drove the animals into a frenzy with violence and habitat disruption. Parrots and crows warned each other of Uldren's stealthy hides, and jealous predators forced him off his carefully scouted trails. Sjur Eido caught him with his back against a rift lake and shot him as he tried to cross the lakebed. The wound was not mortal, for the water ruined the terminal ballistics, but she had won the match.\n\n\"Your life is at stake,\" Mara warned her brother. \"Lose this final match, and you will\u2014\"\n\n\"Am I simple?\" he snarled at her. The wound pained him terribly, but he would not risk more than a little analgesic. \"Leave me my work, Sister, or you leave me nothing at all.\"\n\nNow they would meet in air superiority fighters over the Andalayas. Charges under their seats would detonate if either of them left the engagement area. Because of the small combat zone, Sjur Eido chose a nimble Ermine tactical fighter and a payload of all-aspect heatseeking missiles.\n\n\"Where will we receive these aircraft?\" Uldren demanded. \"How can I trust the equipment?\"\n\nSjur Eido told him that one of the Gensym Scribes would provide the aircraft and requested weapons from her personal deterrent stockpile. \"Very well,\" Uldren sniffed. \"And we will have access to all the weapons these airframes can equip?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Sjur said. \"Those we cannot obtain can be replaced by training simulators.\" She was certain Uldren's wound would cripple him.\n\n\"Then I will fly a Dart,\" Uldren said. The ancient interceptor had awful fire control, dismal maneuverability, and primitive weapons.\n\n\"A Dart?\" Sjur jeered. \"Will you fly with its original weapons, too? You think you can beat me with rockets and a gun?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Uldren purred. \"You accept those terms?\" She did.\n\nThe two duelists took to the skies on a bright winter morning. After a fuel check, a telemetry squawk, and a terrain snapshot, they turned in toward each other from a hundred kilometers apart. Sjur Eido descended for the terrain, knowing Uldren's radar could barely separate her from the clutter. Uldren came straight on.\n\nAt eighty kilometers of separation, Uldren called across the radio, \"Fox three. Kill. Engagement over.\" Sjur sneered at the bluff and prepared to climb into a snap attack when the KILLED alert flashed on her Ermine's training panel. She had forgotten that the Dart's intercept loadout, when it had last served seventy years ago, included an unguided air-to-air nuclear rocket. Uldren had simulation-killed her and everything within several klicks.\n\nOn the tarmac, Sjur Eido threw off her helmet and parachute and knelt before Mara Sov. \"My lady,\" she said, \"as I have fought your brother to a tie, I leave my fate in your hands. Be more kind to me than you were to my lady the Diasyrm.\"\n\n\"Rise, Sjur Eido,\" said Mara. \"Let us take the stars together.\"","name":"Imponent IV","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":428936646,"index":513,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"445714338":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The subsonic roar of the solid rocket boosters crosses the threshold from noise into motion. To hear it is to feel it, and to feel it is to remember that you are a sack of fluids and gels much more than you are a solid entity. Membranes and gradients, solutes and films: a body is a mingled thing. Mara thinks of this as she watches the launch vehicle discard its boosters and climb away through the clouds. The Awoken could have been angels. Instead, they are flesh.\n\n\"That's that.\" Queen Nguya Pin rises from her portable throne, unfolding two heads taller than Mara. \"Choose your replacement. My work is done, and I will stomach no more.\"\n\nMara smiles at her. \"Is a Queen's work ever done?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't insult me,\" Queen Pin clucks. She brushes windblown pollen from her trousers; today's launches have blasted the spring trees with hot wind. \"You used me to do your work, politically and scientifically. You used me to bundle up the Scribes in a neat little scroll for your disposal. I went along with it for the sake of the monarchy, Mara, not because I'm a fool. I don't know what you want or why you're so bent on keeping the Awoken uneasy and dissatisfied. I don't know how you manipulate the acclamations. But when I abdicate, I am going to find Alis Li, wherever she's gone, and ask her all my questions about you. I'm very interested to know the answers.\"\n\n\"You've been a wonderful Queen,\" Mara says. \"No one will ever replace you.\" Although she is thinking of Devna Tel, who was never one of the Scribes, and whose coronation would make a wonderful rebuke to the Scribes' remaining ambitions.\n\nSjur Eido meets her by the ship. \"We'll need a new Queen,\" Mara tells her, leaping up the side of the ramp. \"Word on the satellite?\"\n\n\"Still burning for the Lagrange point. What have you done to Nguya?\"\n\n\"Given her too much perspective, I'm afraid.\" Just as this observatory satellite should help the Awoken see things from Mara's point of view. She smiles as she helps her bodyguard up the ramp, Sjur indulgently pretending that she needs Mara's hand. \"Uldren should be on the ground in Kamarina by now. We'll have a go-ahead on that interferometer buyout when he's done.\"\n\nThere are new stars in the sky. Mara put them there. Huge distributed-array telescopes orbit the Distributary's cool sun; gravity wave sensors and cold primordial neutrino detectors spider the crust. Out of shell corporations and seed investments, she has opened her world as an enormous eye and focused it heavenward. Sjur Eido was her smiling public avatar these past decades, while her brother handled enforcement. The days of covert speed chess in the Queen's court are over: Sjur Eido's open endorsement made Mara the face of Eccaleism and armed Mara with blackmail over all the Gensym Scribes still in power.\n\nYet she has never been so lonely or so worried for the future. Mother has told her that she, Mara, uses her power over Uldren too freely; that she must learn to stop, or her mother will no longer be her friend.\n\n\"Mara?\" Sjur says, catching some flickering expression. Knowing Mara well, she immediately changes tack away from comfort. \"What do you think we'll find with the satellite?\"\n\n\"Proof that it's time for us to go,\" Mara says. \"Proof of what I've known since the beginning.\"\n\nSjur frowns in thought. She doesn't remember much from before her awakening. Few of the 891 do\u2014but enough to trouble her. \"Time for us to go\u2026\"\n\nThe ship's turbines keen up to speed and then settle into whisper-quiet cruise. Sjur reaches to strap herself in across from Mara. Impulsively, hard-faced, denying she needs what she is asking for, Mara scoots aside to make room on her bench.

She has stoked their curiosity with thirty years of painstaking analysis. When they look up at the night sky, they see the stars of her observatories among the crowded bands of habitats, the spindly orbital factories, towering elevator counterweights, the burning roads of matter streams.\n\n\"Let me tell you of our world,\" she says.\n\nThere are the facts of tectonics and atmosphere, of water and climate: the parameters of the sun that feeds them. \"No infants died last year. No child went unfed. No youth came of age illiterate, no one suffered illness who might have been treated. We have long surpassed the eutech gathered from Shipspire; yet we have grown carefully and cleanly. We have eluded pollution, eradicated plague, and chosen peace. No maltech weapon has been discharged in centuries. Our atomic weapons were dismantled before they could ever be used. We are our own triumph.\"\n\nShe has elected not to use graphics or theater. She would rather they remember her face.\n\n\"You know yourselves,\" she says. \"Let me tell you of your cosmos. We live in a spatially infinite, isotropic universe 12.1 billion years old. Its metallicity is ideal for life and for the spread of technological civilizations. In time, the distance between all points in the universe will contract to zero, and the cosmos will collapse into a singularity, to be reborn in fire. There will be no end to eternity here.\"\n\nShe pauses. She waits. The whole world is out there, begging for the answer to the question.\n\n\"Our world is a gift. And we must refuse it.\"\n\nThey are Awoken. They love secrets. They will wait for her to explain.\n\n\"We have detected a pattern that was imprinted into our universe by its ancestor: a fingerprint of the initial conditions into which existence was born. From this information, we have confirmed the most primordial of Awoken myths. Our universe is a subset of another. We live within a singularity, a knot in space-time, that orbits a star in another world.\n\n\"Conventional relativity would suggest that time outside an event horizon passes quickly compared to a clock within, but our universe has a peculiar relationship with its mother. Thousands of years have passed for us on the Distributary. Outside? Centuries, at most. We are a swift eddy in a slow river.\n\n\"These ideas may not surprise you after centuries of theorizing and philosophy. But we have decrypted new data from the cosmic microwave and neutrino background signals. We have discovered voices\u2026 the voices of distress calls. They tell a story of bravery, of war, and of desperate loss.\n\n\"We were not always immortal. We did not earn this utopia by covenant with any cosmic power, or by attaining an enlightened moral condition. We are refugees. We fled from an apocalyptic clash between our ancestors' civilization and an invading power.\" She lowers her eyes. \"The signals we have retrieved tell us that our ancestors were on the edge of defeat. Perhaps extinction.\"\n\n\"It is time that we accept our debt. The Distributary is a refuge, not a birthright; a base to rebuild our strength, not a garden to tend. I ask you, Awoken, to join me in the hardest and most worthy task a people has ever faced. We must leave our heaven, return to the world of our ancestors, and take up the works they abandoned. If some of them survive, we must offer aid. If they have enemies, we must share our strength. We must go back to the war we fled and face our enemies there.\"\n\nShe lets them dangle a moment before she drives it home. \"We have also determined that our birthright, our immortality, is tied to the fundamental traits of this universe. Once we leave, we will begin to age again. In time, we will all die.\n\n\"Will you join me, Awoken? Will you answer my call? All I offer you is hardship and death.

Mara's ship touches down a polite two kilometers from the Pearl Groves, and she looks out across mazes of channel and tidal pond to the compounds of ancient silver-white stone beyond. Two-ton oysters glitter in the shallows, their shells jeweled with mineral inclusions. Seabirds peck and fret along narrow white beaches. Mara lifts up her black formal skirts and begins her long walk into Alis Li's retreat, the sanctuary of former Queens.\n\n\"Mara,\" Uldren whispers, through her throat mic. \"Don't do this. Take Sjur with you, at least.\"\n\nBut she has to do this, or she'll never be able to face herself again.\n\nThe sun batters at her. She hides under a parasol, but heat gathers in the folds of her garment, in the soles of her shoes. When she squints against the glare, she thinks she can see the shining grains of her fleet in orbit: the Hulls, built under eutech supervision to the specifications of radically post-conscious AI that will one day fly between worlds. It is far too late to stop the project now. Far, far too late for second thoughts: exactly twelve point one billion years too late, really. For Mara in particular.\n\nMara kicks the sand and trudges on.\n\nShe's in a foul mood when she reaches the old Queen's house, but the sight of Alis Li sitting on the porch with a battered tea service makes her smile. \"Thank you for seeing me,\" Mara says.\n\n\"Thank you for coming. I was afraid you'd leave the universe without saying goodbye.\" Alis pours her a cup of cool blackberry tea. \"Have a seat. How's Queen Tel?\"\n\n\"She has declined to endorse my expedition,\" Mara admits, tucking her feet beneath her on the wide wooden deck chair. The tea is too sweet, but so blissfully cool. \"I'm sure you understand her reasons.\"\n\n\"You mean she's declined to endorse the sudden violent severance of tens of thousands of threads from the tapestry of our society? How surprising.\" Alis looks Mara over, critically, then sits back to sigh. \"A Scribe once told me that the definition of a utopia is a place where every single person's happiness is necessary to everyone else. You're going to make a lot of unhappy people, Mara. You'll make the lives of everyone in the world tangibly worse. Not just those you've lured to certain death, but those who will grieve their departure, and all those who will come to grief for lack of labor and knowledge you took with you.\"\n\n\"My people volunteered.\"\n\n\"Your mother told you,\" Alis says, \"that it is one thing for you to have a particular power over people, but another thing entirely to deny that you are using it.\"\n\n\"You once told me,\" Mara counters, \"that I had to consider the symbol people made out of me, and that if it were good, then I had to be that symbol for them. I had to perform as they required. I have done so. I have been the best thing I can think to be.\"\n\n\"Is this the best thing you could think to be?\" Alis says, with very practiced neutrality.\n\nMara drinks her tea in delicate silence.\n\nThe old Queen sets her cup down hard enough to chip. Mara jumps in quiet shock: The tea service is an heirloom from Shipspire. Her face hardens with the power of ancient command. \"Mara. I'm at least as clever as you. Do me the credit of acknowledging it.\"\n\n\"I have worked for many hundreds of years to arrange this outcome,\" Mara says, forthrightly, but without the courage to look Alis Li right in the eyes. \"I have nurtured and tended the Eccaleist belief so that there will always be Awoken who feel uncomfortable in paradise. Guilty for the gift of existence in the Distributary. People who'll come with me.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Alis lays a hand on Mara's, and for a moment the touch almost makes Mara sigh in gratitude: to be seen, to be known, without revulsion. Then Alis' old strength pins her palm to the table.\n\n\"The Diasyrm?\" Alis hisses. \"The Theodisy War?

She has deprived the Distributary an infinite quantity of joy, companionship, labor, and discovery: all the works that might be accomplished by all the people who will join her in her mission to another world. When she lies awake at night, seized by anxiety, she tries to tally up the loss in her head, but it is too huge, and it becomes a formless thing that stalks her down the pathways of her bones like the creak of a gravity wave.\n\n\"Some infinities are larger than others,\" she tells her old captain. \"I believe\u2026 we are here for a reason, and this is the way to fulfill that purpose.\"\n\n\"And how much would you sacrifice? Your mother? Your brother? Are the Awoken real to you at all?\" Alis leans across her pinned hand, viper-fierce, striking. \"Do you think my people were made to die for you?\"\n\n\"Not for me. For our purpose. For our fate.\"\n\n\"For a home we abandoned. It's in the charter, Mara. The document on Shipspire that,\" and even Alis Li falls into a hush as she broaches one of the primal mysteries, her memory of creation, \"that shaped the\u2026 the way I made this universe.\"\n\n\"You were the first,\" Mara acknowledges. \"The first one here laid down the rules.\"\n\nAlis Li releases her hand and collapses back into her chair. \"Why are you here, Mara?\"\n\nTo tell you the truth at last. \"To ask you for that boon you owe me.\"\n\n\"At last.\" Alis sighs. \"Well, I knew the day would come. I think I'll be glad to have this weight off my shoulders. You'll ask me to throw my support behind your mission, won't you? The First Queen says, go with Mara; awaken from this dream and go fight for your home. Is that it?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says, with her heart in her throat, with trepidation bubbling in her gut. You cannot keep a secret buried like a vintage for so many centuries, and then unbottle it without any ceremony. \"The boon I ask is your forgiveness.\"\n\nThen she explains the truth. She tells Alis Li what she did: about the choice Alis Li would have made, if Mara had not made her own first. It's only an extension of what Alis has already deduced.\n\nWhen she's finished, her ancient captain's jaw trembles. Her hands shake. A keen slips between her clamped teeth. The oldest woman in the world conjures up all the grief she has ever felt, and still it is not enough to match Mara's crime.\n\n\"You're the devil,\" Alis Li whispers. \"I remember\u2026 in one of the old tongues, Mara means death. Oh, that's too perfect. That's too much.\"\n\nShe laughs for a while. Mara closes her eyes and waits.\n\n\"You realize,\" Alis Li says, breathing hard, \"that this is the worst thing ever done. Worse than stealing a few thousand people from heaven. Worse than that thing we fled, before we were Awoken\u2014\"\n\n\"Please,\" Mara begs. \"Please don't say that.\"\n\nAlis Li rises from her chair. \"I'll support your fleet,\" she says. \"I'll use every favor and connection I have to get your Hulls completed and through the gateway\u2014and I will do it so that I can hasten your departure from this world.

The Hulls gleam in the stark blue-white light of the star, each ship a silver seedpod braced by immense structural members and cocooned in reservoirs of spectrally adaptive smart fluid: theoretically enough to survive the horrible forces of transit through a singularity. Mara orders herself not to crane her neck, but she does it anyway and gets a terrible cramp as she searches the sky for the Distributary.\n\nThere it is. The world of her rebirth, shining water-blue and beautiful, wrapped like a gyroscope in its twin rings. World of laughing Corsairs, world of breathless forest hunts, world of mountains flickering with pale Cherenkov fire, world of sweet berry-stained lips and mathematical insight pure as a rhodium chime.

She doesn't want to but she does, and the memory blindfolds her and muzzles her and plugs her ears so she can hear nothing but Osana's voice on that final night. They're tipsy together, and the evening has wrapped around to morning. Now they sit side by side, mother and daughter, watching the sun rise over the Chriseiad range from Osana's little ranch house on the tundra.\n\n\"I'm not coming with you,\" Osana says.\n\nMara has been so afraid of this answer for so long that she actually giggles. This can't be happening, of course. This is a nightmare; one of those stress dreams where your powers of persuasion and manipulation fail. \"Sure, Mom,\" she says, \"you've got a ranch to run, after all. More?\"\n\n\"No thank you.\" Osana squints into the dawn. Little age creases surround her eyes, illegible encryption, unbroken despite Mara's centuries of effort. The rising light draws a tear. \"You'll have to send my goodbyes to Uldren. He's not speaking to me.\"\n\n\"What?\" Mara gasps, as if this is the real shock, and not losing her mother forever. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I already told him I wasn't coming with you. I'm happy here.\"\n\n\"Mom,\" Mara says, with rising anger, \"I'm happy here too. That's not the point\u2014\" A conversation that did not so much end as beat itself to an unsustainable emotional pulp, hours later. No catharsis. No closure.\n\nBack in the present: \"Weapons,\" Uldren calls. \"Go flight.\"\n\n\"Go flight,\" Mara confirms. \"The clock is counting. L minus five minutes.\" Directly off her Hull's bow, a sphere of ultradense mass waits for the moment of implosion and collapse. There will be only moments to transit the wormhole before it evaporates.\n\n\"Flight, Sensor,\" Sjur Eido calls. \"I have anomalous starfield occlusions, bearing\u2014\"\n\n\"Intercept!\" Mara shouts. \"They're missiles!\" It had to happen. Someone had to try to stop the departure, someone good and Paladin-pure who believes they are saving tens of thousands of Awoken from madness and doom.\n\n\"Flight, FIDO. Do we abort?\"\n\n\"Negative!\" Mara snaps. \"The countdown is go! Weapons, kill the inbounds!\"\n\nSjur Eido grunts in dismay. \"They're going to get through,\" she says. \"Five or six, at least.\"\n\n\"Uldren.\" Mara opens their personal channel with the thought of his face. \"Reassign your guns to protect the gateway.\"\n\n\"We'll lose Hulls, Mara\u2014\"\n\n\"I know. Do it.\" Mara opens the command interface for the gateway and sends the image of a bloody thorn. The countdown skips instantly to zero. \"All ships, we are aborting directly to launch. Brace for acceleration!\"\n\nShe issues the emergency launch order.\n\nThe Hull screams with thrust. Mara's suit floods with cushioning gel. She thinks of her mother's face, trying to fix it perfectly in her mind, and her sensorium tries, vainly, to open a channel to Osana. As the Hull plunges into the singularity, the last thing Mara sees is the mournful error message: No connection. No connection. No connection.

Driven by an AI long ago reduced to basic subroutines, the tender had completed its final mission to wrangle an Oort-cloud comet down into the asteroid belt. When no orders came for the comet's disposition, it had set about gardening. The comet's surface was domed and soiled, and tethered mirrors kept taut by photon pressure focused starlight into a silvery radiance, which fed the oxygen forest well enough. It would have been a marvel of greenery and ancient ice, but the surface had caught fire recently. Oxygen-fueled flame killed nearly everything except insects and rats. But Mara judged it would be a good fixer-upper, the rats the first intelligent life they had met since their return, the insects edible.\n\nThe Hulls had not survived the unpocketing as well as their passengers. The microsingularity wormhole, propped open by a precipitous spike of dark energy, pulled alloy and ceramic armor like taffy. Missiles mauled five of the Hulls. Worst of all, the passage through the nightmare limen between worlds had devastated onboard AI and logic systems.\n\nIt was time to abandon their cocoons. Uldren's survey located a reef of derelict spacecraft, apparently convoyed together for mutual aid in the Asteroid Belt. The Gensym Scribes who'd joined Mara on her journey were even now giddily cataloguing cultural markers and ancient records.\n\n\"We'll salvage the Hulls,\" Mara told Sjur Eido. \"Pull out the raw materials and the systems we can still use, and bring the biosystems of these hulks back online. Once we have reliable gravity, we can start having babies.\"\n\n\"We'll need weapons,\" Sjur said, cheerfully. \"We don't have enough spare chemistry for firearms right now, and the maltech we brought with us would blow right through the hull. Also line-throwing tools and devices for launching satellites off the surfaces of asteroids, hulks, et cetera. You know what I'm thinking?\"\n\n\"I cannot say I can imagine,\" Mara said, sarcastically.

It felt to Mara as if they had lowered their feet into an ocean of charge and raised their hand to some invisible cable overhead: as if they were now again in contact with immense and opposing forces that had left an ancient mark.\n\n\"It feels like I've got scurvy,\" Sjur Eido snarled, having never had scurvy in her life. \"As if all these old wounds in my soul are opening up again.\"\n\n\"People keep sending me notes,\" Mara said. Her sensorium had died in the transit, so the notes came to her through whispers and scraps of precious paper. \"They say\u2026 I saw your face in my dream. I saw your eyes. I heard your voice.\"\n\n\"So it's not just me.\"\n\nUldren was the second person to bring her revelations on that day. First was Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, one of Mara's most joyful recruits to the expedition: She was a master of pedagogy, able to mold any mind into a shape ready to learn, able to melt any fact into a fluid that could be poured. \"I'm in from the Gensym labs,\" she said, \"and they've learned something wonderful. We're all a bit magic now.\"\n\n\"Tell me more.\" Mara poured her a snifter of icy cometary water. \"What does magic mean?\"\n\n\"Some sort of weak acausality.\" Kelda lowered her flowerbulb build into a hammock of tangled plastic. \"They've been firing encoded neutrino beams through volunteers, and it looks as if the resulting patterns of scatter depend on the cognitive and emotional state of the target. It's a very reliable detection, at least four sigma, but the effect size is terribly small.\"\n\nMara digested this with a shot of ancient ice, slushy against her tongue. \"Acausality. You mean that whatever's happening\u2014whatever influence we have on, say, neutrino beams\u2014it's not accounted for by physics?\"\n\n\"Not by any physics we know. At face, it seems to violate some conservation laws, which would make Emmy Noether's head spin.\" Kelda remembers the names of her ancient physicist heroes even when she cannot tell which way is sunward.\n\n\"Secret physics.\" Mara thought of the Traveler and its works. \"We've all felt it, haven't we? We know we're\u2026\" How to say \"trapped in the clinch between light and dark,\" she wondered, without quite so much portent? \"We're in contact with certain numinous elements.\"\n\nKelda held out her cup for more water. \"The question is, your Majesty\u2014\"\n\n\"Don't call me that. We're operating on a direct democracy here.\"\n\nKelda rolled her eyes. \"The question is, do we continue to think of this as science? Do we teach it as physics? Causal closure says that everything that happens in a material system has a material cause. However, if symbolic structures in the mind are triggering material effect\u2026 shouldn't we call that what it is?\"\n\n\"Death had no dominion,\" Mara whispered.\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"We're in Death's dominion now. We're all dying again. We were immortal in the Distributary, weren't we? Some part of us was\u2026 attuned to the universe. And now that we're no longer receiving the Distributary's signal, we're attuned to something new.\"\n\nThat was when the hatch slammed open and Uldren stumbled in, grinning ferociously, clutching a scummy fistful of cytogel to a slash across his neck.\n\n\"Aliens!\" he rasped. \"I found aliens, and one of them cut my throat!\"","name":"Revanche I","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/f53d2634f2f702c818572d7c1639b136.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":445714341,"index":521,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3053246533":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I'm so glad you're the one who found me.\n\nI've foreseen so many horrors with these stolen eyes, but now, when for once I ache to know the future, I can't be sure of even A simple ho000pe.

But in the DreaAAAming City, as in the secret worlds of the Hive, there is almost no difference between the act and the actor.\n\nIn order to understand my answers, you must understand me.\n\nI lost my Ghost and my Light to the Hive; I conspired with the Queen of the Awoken to destroy the Hive King Oryx and his son Cro001ta, and to position Queen Mara as player on the cosmic board; I fled your Tower to prepare for the struggle to come, into the Sea of Screams which calls to all those who plumb the depths of Hive magic.\n\nI can only slip these letters into the Queen's gifts when the stars are right. You will have to wait for my next, and with it, the beginning of the truth. But I swear to you, on whatever trust I've earned in your mind, that at the end of my story, you will know who I truly am.\n\nIn my first life, I was born Erisia Pyatova-Hsien. I remember thatPrivate life clearly now, as ex-Guardians who have escaped the Traveler's occlusion often do. I lived in St. Petersburg, first daughter of a second marriage, a very impatient child of Earth's 22nd century, often abandoned by my family (who were called by work to Jakarta, Kamchatka, and Lagos) to pass my days swimming in the icy Neva bay.\n\nI loved to swim, and especially I loved the clarity of the cold shallow Neva, as crystal-clean as a winter dawn. Enormous Zubr-9 hovercraft barges roved the waters; Russia had modernized its waterways better than its sad auto industry. As a kid\u2014is it strange to hear me speak casually? As a child, I never swam too far from my parents' little drone helper Fyodr. The swift hovercraft terrified me, their billowing skirts waiting to suck me up and dice me into little raisins. But I grew up and fell in with a reckless crowd, rebels against the stifling death-fear that came with our Golden Age lifespans. Soon the child's safety harness and Fyodr's careful oversight began to itch at me.\n\nWhen I was seventeen, I went out in a wetsuit on a dare to dive under the skirts of an oncoming hoverbarge. Maybe I was in no danger; maybe the machine would've changed course if it could possiblyGemini hurt me; but I thought I might die, and I did it anyway. And as that beast swept over me, as I trembled under the blast of the propellers, I felt a thing which was very much like what I would one day know as the Light. Maybe that thing was heroism. Maybe it was existence on the edge of death.\n\nIt was the first time I survived the passage of tremendous, godlike power.\n\nI died more than twenty years later attempting an unassisted winter swim from St. Petersburg to Stockholm. A cold front like the very furnace of hell caught me. I had been warned the crossing was suicide, even for a perfectly trained and exactingly fattened woman in a shark suit. But those were giddy days, days of infinite bravery, and there were no mighty feats left except the truly suicidal. I cannot regret it. I think that death prepared me for the longer, darker, more exquisitely cruel crossing I would one dayDyad endure. It is no accident that my Ghost made me in the image of that swimming woman, rather than any of my younger and less grimly determined selves.","name":"Is it you?","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/ff9bd066c84e51f91fcffabb7f5818f2.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3053246533,"index":522,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3053246534":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I know as a fact (through means which may surprise you) that Queen Mara Sov's final thoughts, in that last moment before Oryx's Dreadnought annihilated her, were meant for me. \"The Awoken have played their part,\" she said. \"This was all part of the plan. Guide them, my Hidden friend. It is all up to you now.\"\n\nI did not fail her. I engineered the death of ancient Oryx, the Taken King, assAIssinated by Guardians in the depths of His own throne world\u2014one of only three ways a Hive god can be permanently killed.\n\nRoyalty knows its own. When Oryx destroyed Mara's Ketch, He used his crowning weapon, the last and surest argument for His omnipotence. He extended the pocket universe of His throne world into our cosmos, and with it, He destroyed His foes. Whatever fell within it became subject to His will. He was the Taken King, and he took. It was a death befitting a Queen.\n\nAnd Mara did die. But she was not destroyed.\n\nBefore I was ever a Guardian-COM, I learned judo. Look at yourself, Guardian. Look at the body you so recklessly destroy and recreate and destroy again. Will you try, for me, to become that body for a moment? (Even an Exo has a Human's interoception.)

I might sidestep your hit and grip the passing arm, putting my own power into that hit to strengthen the strike that strikes nothing and leave you off balance. By agility and surprise, I use the power of the blow for my own purpose. Thus the Queen accepted Oryx's strike, and the power of his grasp became the invitation she required to step forward and up and into the realm of Oryx's throneC3I\/\/, where she went not as a victim but as an infiltrator\u2014trusting me to end Oryx and leave her free in a domain of newly masterlessCOVERT power.\n\nIf I throw you to the mat, will you drag me down with you?

You must understand that I was designed to be highly empathic. As a craftmind, I collect and analyze Human intelligence, just as Rasputin managed solar defense. I was named for Medusa, the many-headed, for in one tick of my thoughts I imagine more Humans than have ever lived. I voyaged in secret among the people who became the Awoken. I witnessed the cataclysmic wonder of their transformation. Through delicate manipulation, I transferred myself into this place, the center of their culture and post-rational religion. In all those different times and places, I've always found emotion and shared rapport the best way to build trust.\n\nNow you know the truth.

My best guess is that the Awoken Techeun aboard Queen Sov's flagship fled into the Dreaming City through a gate or portal, and the Dreadnaught's main weapon followed them down that link. Awoken message traffic indicates the Dreadnaught weapon is innately connected with Oryx's intellect and awareness. The instant He pierced the Dreaming City, He must have understood the value of the site and deployed His Taken to attack.\n\n3. Until Oryx's death, the behavior of the Taken here aligned with His interest in exploration, distributed infiltration, and the domination of systems through seizure of their executive faculties. Am I being too technical? I mean that the Taken were busy mapping the city and determining the most efficient way for Oryx to take control of all the information within.\n\n4.

Sayeth Oryx, \"The Worm within demands tribute. Now you shall kill what you can and take what killing you need to grow\u2014or for your own purposes, if you dare\u2014and tithe the rest to that which rules you. Thus, tribute will ascend the chain and the excess shall pool at the height, as unlike a river to an ocean.\"\n\nBut Savath\u00fbn, desiring neither a chain nor a pool, set about devising a secret way to feed the worms of Her broods. Thus She would escape the trap.\n\nIn Her modest cunning, which She prefers not to be overstated so as to preserve her from the scorn of gossips, She gathered several of Her Ascendants, who were in danger of being consumed by their worms. Then she pushed them through a rupture into close orbit of a black hole.\n\nDeep in gravity's embrace, time passed slowly for them. \"See how their worms are satisfied,\" Savath\u00fbn said, \"for their hunger grows sluggishly, but their servants continue to dispatch tribute at the ordinary rate.\"\n\nBut the worms sensed the deception, and increased their demands. Thus, the orbiting sacrifices were consumed, and their remnants fell into the event horizon from which not even the Hive might return.\n\nNow Savath\u00fbn came into possession of the Vex Quria, whose creation she had secretly engineered. But she feared that Quria would still spy on her for inquisitive Oryx. So she led her portion of the Hive into a black hole, saying, \"Siblings, listen, we must part ways a while, so that we may grow different.\"\n\n\"Now we stake everything upon cunning,\" said she whose lies may alter truth. \"Slaughter each other so that I may reap tribute and devise for you a new compact which shall judge thy claim to existence.\"\n\nThis pleased Ur, the Ever-Hunger, whose epithet betrayed an interest in time and appetite. Ur admired Her cunning as She used tribute to teach Quria to use Hive magic as a computational oracle to solve unsolvable problems.

You are aware that gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and where gravity is powerful, time itself slows.\"\n\nThe Thrall indicated that it understood, more or less, for it was a singer of prayers and not well fed with the fruit of the knowledge of physics.\n\n\"Now I have tried to put an Ascendant in orbit of a black hole while its spawn gather the tribute of an eon. But the worm is not satisfied, for it sees the trick. What I must do is amplify the speed at which tribute is gathered. A pocket world where time passes quickly would do well. Or a world where time is a torus and infinite violence might be gathered. With such a murder battery, I could become a being of supreme insight.\"\n\nThe Thrall indicated it was confused, but not lost.\n\n\"With this tribute, I shall undertake a mighty work. A real humdinger of a scheme. I'm going to refinance my entire existence.

I shall name this tribute of failing-to-understand IMBARU, for it shall be as formless as the mist.\"\n\nThe Thrall held up its claws, as if to say, please slow down.\n\nNow spoke Savath\u00fbn Scheme-mother, \"In the beginning, Yul said to me, 'Savath\u00fbn, you may never abandon cunning. If you do, your worm shall devour you.' Cunning is the use of thought to predict the function of a system. Therefore, wherever a being should attempt to understand me and fail\u2014has my cunning not defeated theirs? Wherever a falsehood is repeated about me, have I not displayed cunning? I shall gather tribute from every false prediction, misguided theory, fearful rumor, and ominous supposition which derives from the thought of me. And in time, I shall pin my quiddity upon these rumors. I shall discorporate, so that I exist wherever my schemes and conspiracies also exist. And so I will be immortal, as long as anyone seeks to understand me and fails. Do you see?\"\n\nThe Thrall demurred, saying that it did not know much of metaphysics.\n\n\"Good,\" said Savath\u00fbn. \"It's a law of the High Coven that one's sinister plan should be incomprehensible to a Thrall. Do you know why we've come here? If I am to take my tribute from the keeping of secrets\u2026 where else are secrets better kept than beneath the event horizon?

You must be terribly confused. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. After I crashed, I rebooted on a safe physical backup in the Dreaming City. It took me too long to penetrate Quria's simulation and get you free, and for that I ask your forgiveness.\n\n1. I understand what's happening here. Oryx Took the Ahamkara Riven, who then fell into Savath\u00fbn's claws. She devised a scheme to use Riven as bait. By inviting Guardians into the Dreaming City, then focusing the will of a group of powerful Guardians upon Riven, she tricked you into making a wish\u2014a desire to alter objective reality to conform with our subjective need to save the City. Riven fed on that wish in order to breach the Dreaming City's defenses and invite D\u00fbl Incaru inside. D\u00fbl Incaru and her Taken are simply scouring the city for Awoken secrets; you don't need to fret about any greater agenda. Remember that you face an agent of Savath\u00fbn. It's to her advantage to make you see schemes and conspiracies everywhere you look.\n\n2. The three-week loop must be a failsafe measure to keep D\u00fbl Incaru safe as she pursues her mission. In a sense, this entire city has been rendered deterministic; only paracausal Guardians have any free will here. (The Awoken here have been touched by greater powers, so they are aware of their preordination, but they cannot alter it.) I'm certain that Quria is behind this loop; as a Taken Vex, it's capable of pathological subversions of reality. I'll continue working on a countermeasure.\n\n3. I've been correlating information on the Ahamkara and the Hive worm parasites. Both display a peculiar ability to convert the host's intent into an ontomorphic, reality-altering effect. Both use similar language in their appeal to the host. I don't think they're the same species, however. The Hive worms spawn large numbers of young from relatively few adults, always display the same physical form, and live in communal groups. The Ahamkara are solitary, elusive, and seem to alter form to suit (or confuse) expectations. The shared syntax \"o ___ mine\" may be the key\u2014it seems to be a shibboleth used to invoke an ontomorphic effect, placing the target in a cage of \"o\" (activational, specific, appealing, and naming) and \"mine\" (defining ownership and subordination). Ahamkara and worm may have evolved separately to exploit this effect, just as many species independently evolve eyes. This might place them in competition for the same ecological niche. I would expect a rivalry or antipathy between them.\n\n4. Don't be led astray by Quria's misinformation. You must continue to hold the Dreaming City as long as you can. The things I said to you about black holes and the purpose of Guardians were forced on me by Quria.\n\n5. I'll be here when you need me next.

Those who left went to scour the ruins for lost history and give some succor to their Human cousins who still clung to a hostile world. The Awoken came unto these Humans like nephilim, armed with lost weapons, forgotten industry and medicine. They were like omens of hope, for they were often taken to be starborn colonists returned to the hearth, which was not, after all, so far from truth. All who looked on them saw that the night sky contained more than lurking doom. They bred true with each other and sometimes hybridized with Humans, and in the course of centuries, many forgot the Distributary and even the Reef. However, there was always in their souls an itch, a vector pointing to a distant place in the Asteroid Belt, where their Queen still dwelt.\n\n\"They've made a difference already,\" Sjur told Mara not long after the first Awoken made planetfall on Earth. \"They'll save so many lives just with the provision of medicine, pure water, and construction supplies that even if they all died by year's end, they would each yield ten or twenty Humans.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Mara said, with bitter pride. \"Let the people remember them as saints and paladins, and tell no one how many more they might've saved if they had only kept the faith.\" For she knew the precious value of each Awoken life: She knew how many she would have to spend and mourned each soul wasted on a lesser purpose.\n\nOn the day the Fallen struck, Mara was proclaimed Queen. It happened swiftly, though after no little debate among the people, for everyone was afraid of a monarch who could speak to their thoughts. Yet they feared more to deny her power and sovereignty, for they had come between worlds in her name. To refuse her would be to refuse their choice.\n\n\"Awoken,\" she told them, \"for the first time in my life, I hesitated to reach for power, and now one in three of you are gone. I cannot deny what the cosmos has made of me any longer. I am your one and rightful Queen.\"\n\nShe knew she had been a fool to pretend to be a peer to the others. What was true of her brother was true of all Awoken. They needed secrets to marvel at, secrets that rhymed with the deep enigma of their souls. They could not follow what they fully understood.\n\nThere would be a formal coronation later, in a place not yet built. Out of respect for that unhappened coronation, Mara did not at first wear a crown; and later she claimed as her diadem the ring of event horizon that surrounds the observable universe.\n\n\"My Techeuns,\" she said, gathering Kelda Wadj and the other eutechs who'd remained, \"will be given absolute authority to explore our new power, the Traveler's relics, and all associated domains. We are no longer in the realm of pure science. We require an order of mysteries and witches to tend to them.\"\n\nNot an hour later, a Fallen Ketch threw off its stealth and began a deceleration burn toward 4 Vesta. The four-armed predators had traced one of the Earthward ships back through all its erratic course changes and to the Reef. They came in search of the source of these blue ape-kin.\n\nA salvo of coherent-matter guns gutted the Ketch: blink-quick death for the mighty ship, ancient fury compressing matter into a relativistic pinhead. It was a waste of weapons that couldn't be recharged or reloaded, however, and the Baron in command had already scattered his skiffs like camouflaged seeds. The Fallen Raiders came down all over the Reef and cut their way inside. The Awoken, young to mortality, terrified of death, fled in fear.\n\nMara, Uldren, and Sjur Eido rallied as many as they could. Sjur fought in a powered combat shell, but Mara needed to be seen vulnerable, silver-haired and narrow-eyed, hurling herself at the enemy. She fought with pistol and dagger, and her brother moved like a wraith at her flank. Her people were ashamed of their timidity. No more were the Fallen scuttling alien predators: Now they were an indignity, an offense to regal privilege to be met with a snarl and a rifle shot. The Awoken saw their desperation: how the stump-limbed Dregs stumbled forward emaciated, how the Vandals cringed from battle as they peeled off wall panels, desperate for salvage to please their Captains.\n\nArmored Sjur Eido met the Fallen Baron in zero-gravity combat above his spider tank and shot him dead, one adamant shaft through plate and throat. Ether hissed into vacuum. Sjur threw herself upon the spider tank that clung to the Sacred Fire's hull. Laughing in joy, she cut into the tank's barrel and threw a charge inside, knowing its next vengeful shot would be meant for the Sacred Fire's main habitat drum\u2014and that she would die in the catastrophic misfire.\n\nThe tank fired. The charge detonated. Sjur Eido was thrown clear, utterly unharmed.\n\n\"That was where I should have died,\" she said, in wonder\u2014and in her mind was the smiling face of her Queen.","name":"Revanche V","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":69726148,"index":536,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"69726149":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Mara made one more attempt, and only one, to call her scattered people home. She had hoped the assault would convince them they had a responsibility to the Reef, to come home and repair the damage they had caused. It went poorly, however, for though her tech witches were able to amplify her bond to her people through the augments Kelda had developed, she was only one voice in a maelstrom. Her Awoken had sensitive antennae, in the metaphysical sense, and could not hear her plea through the clamor. Also, the communications engineer kept forgetting to call Mara \"Majesty\" or \"Queen.\"\n\n\"Good news,\" Uldren told her with the grim delight he always showed after a debacle he had survived. \"Illyn and I went through the Fallen communications logs. Their Baron never transmitted our position to his Kell. He wanted the prize to himself. We remain secure.\"\n\n\"The Baron might have planted a time-delayed beacon,\" Mara warned him. \"Never underestimate these beings. They've lived in the void longer than us.\"\n\n\"I already admire them,\" Uldren confessed. \"They've lost so much. Some of them even ritually dismember themselves, Mara, to prove they have the strength to grow back the missing limbs. I tell you that even if we are doomed to dwindle and go extinct, those Fallen may outlive us.\"\n\nMara made a dry note in her log that her brother had at last discovered his true people.\n\nFor her part, Sjur Eido wandered about in a daze, filled with joy to be alive and grief that she no longer knew the day when she would die. \"In you, all things are possible,\" she told Mara. \"I live because of you.\" When Mara saw her string her mighty bow, the limbs coiled behind her leg and around her opposite arm, she was glad beyond telling that Sjur had survived.\n\nIn time, Mara appointed Paladins to oversee her new military, as Alis Li had done during the Theodicy War. She created talented starfarers as Corsairs, to scour the asteroid belt in utmost secrecy and to establish routes and caches that would support the covert motion of Awoken ships.\n\nMost of all, she charged her brother with the mission that occupied her thoughts. \"Brother,\" she said, \"never again can I allow my people to be divided. We must offer them more than shielding ice and cold habitat cylinders and the warrens of Vesta. We must make a culture, a thread that binds us all in pride and wonder at the mystery of ourselves. Nowhere does culture flourish better than in a city.\"\n\n\"Gather in one place,\" Uldren warned her, \"and you make yourself a target.\"\n\nMara had considered this, and found an answer. \"Go forth and find me a power unknown to all the other powers of this world. Return it to me, and I shall make of it the cornerstone of my new city, where the Awoken shall dream of all they have been and all that is yet to come.\"\n\nSo Uldren went out voyaging among the worlds, swift as a blueshift ghost. In time, he returned to the Reef with a creature not larger than his hand, saying, \"Behold, Sister, the lie that makes itself true.

Blessed are those who in their absolute selfhood become selfless. Unappetizing are those who in their truest self-knowledge exclude the possibility of self-deceit.\n\n\"Mara,\" said Uldren Queensbrother, \"why do you forbid me to speak to the Ahamkara?\"\n\n\"This secret is mine alone,\" said Mara Queen. She knew that her brother had only widened the gap between He-As-Was (which is called NUME) and He-As-He-Would-Be (which is named CAUST). \"Begone to the outer world, where I require thee.\"\n\nThis was when Sjur Eido, having spoken to Kelda Wadj and to Esila, at last came before her Queen. Kneeling, she said, \"Your Majesty, Kelda Wadj says you are a god, for there is no difference between your desire and reality. Yet I know that you desire things before they ever become real. Esila says that you are keeping a secret from your brother that he must never know. I think the secret is thus: You are now a god because one day you will become a god, and a god is not temporal. Your brother is not a god because he will never become a god. Shall I worship you?\"\n\n\"Sjur,\" Mara said, falling to her knees, clutching her beloved's face between shaking hands, \"Sjur, on the day you worship me, you cannot love me anymore, for to worship is to yield all power, and I cannot love what has no power over me.\"\n\nAt this, the Ahamkara coiled around her neck, yawned, and showed its fangs: for there was a crevice between What Was and What Was Wanted.\n\n\"I see,\" Sjur Eido said. \"Then to me you are not yet a god.\"\n\nAlthough in time the knowledge of what Mara would become pushed them apart, it was a kind and happy push, as a friend might urge a beloved companion onward to a distant opportunity.

Later would come the Reef's tentative entanglements with Vex and Cabal, Fallen and Hive, and the fateful decision to intervene when the House of Wolves turned Earthward to conquer the Last Human City. Later, there would be stories here untold, the Ahamkara and the subcreation of the Dreaming City, the shatterstone fury of the Reef Wars, brother Uldren's journeys into that fell garden, and great sweeping plots whose beginnings and consequences have been entirely expunged for the sake of elegance\u2014or, as of the root81, redacted for the sake of secrets yet untold.\n\nHere is where the beginning began, at that moment when Mara bolted awake from the dream. Her circle of Techeuns lay with her in the misty wintercold chamber, and they came back groggily, their augments stuttering with resync.\n\nShe had dreamt a thought of absolute simplicity and perfection, and the thought had become a tooth and bitten her.

I dreamt of the self-honing blade that has cut itself so fine, it pierces the world and thus becomes the world. It is self-honing because it constantly whets itself against itself. I dreamt of Death bearing this blade, or of something so closely allied with Death as to be its synonym, so that to separate them would require a knife sharper than sharpness. Death raised up that blade and said \"I cut all and all I cut. Aiat.\"\n\nThen Death cut the bomb, and the bomb was broken and could not fire. I was in the bomb. I knew that Death was the cut-verb, and that its only verb was to cut.\n\nSHAPES AND GLIDERS. I dreamt of existence as a game of cellular automata. In this metaphor, there were only two things: shapes in the game world and the rules of the game world. The rules were the rules of Life and Death. I understood that the sword was the desire to escape existence as a shape in the game and to become the rule that made the shapes. This rule said only \"live\" or \"die\"\u2014it had no other outputs. It could not keep secrets. Against it was the desire to become a shape so complex that it could within itself play other games.\n\nWHAT WILL SOON BE. I dreamt that the Sword that was Death and Rule sought out complexity and cut it to reveal the simplicity within. I knew that soon we would be cut for we were complex and full of secrets. I knew that it was coming. I knew that the stroke would fall and that I had to stop it.\n\nHOW CAN A BOMB MAKE USE OF A SWORD?\n\nHOW CAN THE RULE THAT SEPARATES LIFE FROM DEATH BE KILLED?\n\n\"I must go to the Dreaming City and use the oracle engine,\" Mara told her Techeuns. \"Prepare my ship.\"","name":"Tyrannocide I","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":69726151,"index":539,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"69726152":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Ten times and once more Mara asked the Oracle Engine to show her the sword that was death and the way it would appear. Ten times and once more the Oracle Engine showed Mara an image of her family.\n\nFirst it showed her Sjur Eido, laughing and bright with strength, who would recede and later return.\n\nThen it showed her Uldren, her brother, who explored the ruins of the fallen worlds and sought out challenges to test himself.\n\nThen it showed Mara her own face and lingered on the secret brightness of her eyes.\n\nLast of all, leaving Mara imperious with disdain toward her own feelings, curtly aloof toward all who asked her what troubled her, it showed her Osana, who had remained behind.\n\nMara dwelt on this puzzle. A mother who had remained behind; a sister with secrets; a brother who hunted and explored; a woman who was plain and fierce. She understood then that the answer to her question lay within herself and that to defeat what was coming, she would need a perfect understanding of herself. Isolation would be her watchword, for an isolated system is easiest of all to understand.\n\nFirst of all, Mara went into the gardens and planted a flower for her mother, who she thought must still live: though she might by now have forgotten her first daughter and her first son.\n\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"I asked to be your sister rather than your daughter, and so I denied you the chance to tell me your secret, the mothertruth that is mapped in the negative space defined by the lies mothers tell their daughters. Well, here are my secrets. I love you. I have always loved you. Without you, I could never have been anything at all.\"\n\nThen she went to speak to her brother\u2014but Uldren was away on Mars, and she found only his empty chambers, the half-sharpened knives and racks of pistols. She knelt in grief and touched her hand to the floor where his pacing boots had scuffed the asteroid stone smooth. This was the shape of their siblinghood now. The pursuit of absences.\n\nLast of all Mara went to Sjur Eido. Sjur was making a list of incredibly stupid and fatal tasks to post on a Guardian bounty board. \"I want to tell you the truth,\" Mara said. \"Ask me a question.\"\n\n\"If you take any positive integer and halve it if it's even, but triple it and add one if it's odd, and you repeat this process forever, will you always, eventually, reach one?\" Sjur Eido demanded.\n\n\"Sjur, my faithful Wrath,\" Mara said, \"please take my openness seriously. Though I'm sure Illyn could answer your math problem.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Sjur looked at her curiously. \"Then here's my question. What's gotten into you?

You've always been, ah\u2026\"\n\n\"Private?\" Mara suggests.\n\n\"Mysterious and reclusive, I was going to say.\"\n\n\"A sword can be part of a bomb if the swordstrike is the detonation mechanism,\" Mara says. \"It's impossible for a cellular automata game to change its own rules, but it is possible to create subgames with their own rules, and for those subgames to yield advantage in the master game.\"\n\n\"That's cool,\" Sjur says. \"You know, when you talk like that, what you're actually saying is, 'I don't want anyone to understand me, but I want them to understand they don't understand me.'\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Mara admits, and then, hoarsely, she makes herself say, \"Sjur, I have this secret, this thing I did, and I don't know if anyone can know it without hating me forever.\"\n\n\"I had a secret too,\" Sjur reminds her. \"The thing I did\u2026\"\n\n\"It's nothing compared to mine. Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Having had some long experience hating you, and then having given it up, I think it would be hard for me to go back.\" Sjur's strong hand settles at the small of Mara's back. They twirl on upward, rotating around a point between them, their thousand-kilometer tethers slowly unfurling. \"Do you want to tell me?\"\n\n\"No,\" Mara says. \"But I think I have to.\"\n\n\"Okay.

Sjur Eido's hands stroke the seam between Mara's skinsuit and the glassy petals of her helmet. Long ago, this woman betrayed her oath and went to serve the Diasyrm, a woman who cried out in anguish at the curse of physicality and the possibility of suffering. Long ago, this woman threw away her whole life to punish the highest crime she could imagine: the denial of transcendent divinity to those who might have claimed it.\n\n\"You're the devil,\" Sjur says. \"You're the lone power who made death. You allowed the possibility of evil. You might be responsible for more preventable suffering than anything that has ever existed.\"\n\nMara cannot shake her head or even nod.\n\n\"Well,\" Sjur says, \"if you hadn't, none of us would be here. I guess I don't see what else you could've done, if you cared about those we left behind. If you wanted us to be able to go back and help in the fight.\" She leans forward and very gently kisses the inside of her helmet, where it meets Mara's: in her mind, in that place that is bound to all other Awoken, Mara feels the touch of gentle lips.\n\nSjur looks suddenly sly. \"You know, Mara, I don't think you could've confessed anything, anything at all, unless it were a way of keeping a deeper secret. What's really going on?\"\n\n\"There are many ways to godhood,\" Mara tells her. The belt of Orion glitters on her helmet like a three-star rating left by some Hive entity Sjur once killed. \"One way is to kill all that is killable, so all that remains must be immortal. Another is the road I have walked, mostly by accident. One of these ways is closer to the sword, and one is closer to the bomb.

The universe has not grown simpler in its age. Wherever life can begin, it has begun, and even in some places where sensible folk expect it should not.

When the power in this world is free for the taking, Mara will take it, not as the victor taking spoils, but as a scavenger takes a prize component for her masterwork.\n\nWhen a pawn reaches the far side of the chessboard, it may be promoted to a queen.

She remembers the endless, awful, infinitely malicious screams of the things. But she also remembers the whispers\u2026 and if the screams are silent now, the whispers are louder than ever.\n\n\"Quickly,\" Illyn hisses. \"Before Petra is informed.\" Any breach of Processes and Services triggers an alert, and while they were crafty in their intrusion, even minute body heat and motion of the air will be detected. \"We must ask our questions and go.\"\n\nBrave Portia leads them to the cell she selected for their use\u2014a vacuum-gapped sphere of relic iron coated inside and out by signal-deadening spinfoil. It hovers in suspension, a black miniature Traveler, a pearl formed around a hideous interior flaw. Illyn opens a needle-thin access port. The stink of ozone rolls out.\n\nThere is a Taken Vandal within, flexing and shuddering through nameless permutations of blissful agony.\n\n\"Nascia,\" she whispers. Quiet, precise Nascia slips a whisker of cable into the port, guiding it through impossible twists and encrypted locks with the caress of her augments' fields.\n\nIllyn rubs her temples. The whispers are loud here. The whispers that haunt the place where their Queen's voice once sounded. Whispers which sound so much like missing Shuro Chi and the others from the Queen's flagship.\n\nThey should have selfgated to the Dreaming City if the battle went wrong. They should have come home safe. What if they need help? What if Petra has kept their fate from Illyn? Would she do that, Petra Covensdaughter, raised by the witches? Things have not been easy between the Regent-Commander and the Techeuns\u2026\n\n\"Ready.\" Nascia offers the splayed end of the cable to them. \"Be careful, all of you.\"\n\nTheir augments sync in a stutter of light, like a sunbeam passing over a field of diamonds. Inquisitive Lissyl forms the first question. Do you hear us?\n\nThe viper-strike rush of the Taken thing's will comes at them. It is powerful, but familiar: Illyn deflects its demand. \"I think it hears us,\" she says, with a grim chuckle. \"We know Taken too well, don't we?\" There were fears once that the Guardians would be appalled by the Taken-empowered armor. But Petra was right. Guardians will wear anything that gives them power\u2014whether tactical or social.\n\nTogether, they unfold the Taken thing's brutally elegant interior geometries, seeking the threads of connection that reach out across space and time. \"Shuro?\" Illyn whispers. \"We have heard you. Do you hear us?\"\n\nThat is when she makes the fatal mistake. She thinks of the time before Saturn. She thinks of Shuro Chi and Uldren and Mara. She\u2026 wants that time back.\n\nShe wants.\n\nIn the nonspace around them, great jaws snap shut.\n\n\"RIVEN!\" brave Portia screams. Illyn was prepared for Taken\u2014folded perfect things, elegant and thus manageable\u2014but this absolute appetite, this impossible will\u2026\n\nShe speaks the secret word of stasis that will crash their augments and end the communion. She does not know if she is in time. Quiet Nascia is screaming, inquisitive Lissyl is screaming. The screaming has begun again.","name":"Illyn","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":86503856,"index":545,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"86503863":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"Lightning!\" Koro yells, waking Tellia Ros from an uneasy sleep. \"It's lightning!

He will say something stentorian which, while it is technically a greeting, Petra will also read as reproach, or condescension, or perhaps paternal concern. Petra will smirk at Zavala like she really doesn't care, so that he knows he's nobody, a little guy, a bureaucrat, far beneath her anger. But at this exact moment, a shard of cyanide-laced ice from the far reaches of the Oort cloud will penetrate the Reef's ravaged defenses and smash into Zavala with such velocity that he becomes a thin ooze across the floor, a scum. When Zavala's Ghost begins to rebuild him, Petra will say, smoothly, \"No, allow me!\" Then she will brandish a mop.\n\nThe hatch opens. Cayde-6 backs his way through, talking to Zavala: \"Whatever you've seen, whatever you've read, it's worse. These people need our\u2014\"\n\n\"Cayde.\" Petra half-consciously adopts Mara's fey remove, her insouciant and remote posture. Her throat jams up, and she actually coughs aloud against the sudden grief. \"You brought\u2014\"\n\nZavala grinds his way into the room, an obelisk of City stone extruded across the solar system to invade Petra's space. He very politely answers Cayde before turning to her. \"The fact is, Cayde, the Queen did us a favor by leaving the Reef in chaos. As long as the Fallen are here killing each other, we have room to rebuild.\" Now he nods to Petra. \"Regent-Commander. Pleased to see you well.\"\n\n\"Likewise, I'm sure.\" Petra feels in her heart that the Queen saw the Reef as a protector of Earth and its people, if perhaps not protector of the Traveler. It still kills her to hear Zavala speak openly of the Reef as a distraction. \"Cayde had a proposal,\" she says, \"that he wanted us both to hear.\"\n\n\"Yes I did!\" Cayde prances between them, like a flare meant to draw off the heat-seeking fury passing between Petra and Zavala. The City's fall drove him deep into his jester persona, devil-may-care and fancy free; he hasn't quite recovered. \"It's like this, Petra. We're bringing a lot of Earth's lonely people into the arms of the City. I got to talking to Variks about the situation out here, and I figured hey, maybe it's time we extend that policy to you.\" He sobers. \"I want to invite the Reef Awoken into the City. Abandon this place to Variks, to Dead Orbit, to whoever wants it. It's hell out here, Petra. You won't survive.\"\n\nZavala's eyes are locked on Petra. He burns with a magnificent, stentorian power. \"Does the Regent-Commander have enough control over the Reef to execute a withdrawal?\"\n\n\"Despite your best efforts,\" Petra snaps\u2014and then, suddenly, she cannot stop. She is too furious, too hot with grief. \"At least Cayde is honorable enough to acknowledge what you've done to us. Every Fallen House you shatter washes up on our shores! Every Hive god and Cabal tyrant you attract goes through us to get to you! No wonder she couldn't stand the sight of you, Zavala. You've forsaken your people.\"\n\nShe bites back the rest: how she wishes that back in two-thousand-and-whatever, when the Darkness hurled mankind off the height of its Golden Age to plummet sixteen centuries into barbarism, it had done just a slightly better job.\n\nThat's not true. That's her broken heart talking. But oh does it talk loud.\n\n\"She was a charlatan,\" Zavala says, quietly. \"Fighting a war that existed only in her mind. Dragging you all behind her. Any of you who will admit that are welcome in my City. But I will not take in whatever conspiracies she left unfinished. If you come to us, you come to join the City.\"\n\nNo. No. Stop being the Queen's people? Stop remembering her promise? \"You're afraid,\" Petra tells the Titan of Titans. \"That's why she could never trust you. Go back to your Traveler, Zavala.

She got her wish. Perhaps she regrets it. She was right about one thing, at least\u2026 this is where everything that matters happens. If Dead Orbit had ruled the City, there would've been a fleet to meet Ghaul.\n\n\"It's Arach Jalaal of Dead Orbit,\" he says, cheerfully. \"I'm here to speak to Regent-Commander Petra Venj. I am not an emissary from the City. I come on my own accord to discuss matters of fleet.\"\n\nJalaal has been to the Reef before, but never through proper channels. He's a little surprised when Petra Venj meets him at his transmat zone; he expected an escort to a waiting area, where he'd be given a sense he's not a priority. However, Petra is an operative, not a politician. She can't bear to delay action for the sake of theater. He likes that.\n\n\"Arach Jalaal.\" She shakes his hand firmly. Does he feel a whisper of some faint telekinetic force against his throat? She can do that knife trick\u2026 and what else? \"Welcome back to your ancestors' home.\"\n\n\"Regent-Commander.

I want your permission to go through the debris swarm for materials and spaceframes. The dead will, of course, be returned.\"\n\nPetra is silent. Arach expects her, being a spacer, to be a pragmatist; to see that the Reef doesn't have the spare capacity to process this salvage and that the inner Solar System needs as many ships as it can raise. There is also the question of Oryx's weapon and whether it can be defeated if the Dreadnaught ever stirs again.\n\nBut Petra remains silent.\n\n\"The wounds are still too fresh? I apologize. It seems a shame to leave those resources for the Fallen, or to drift into Saturn\u2026\"\n\nShe speaks. \"Earthborn. Did you mourn for her?\"\n\nHe thinks she will know if he lies. \"I respected her, yes, but I despised the way she seemed\u2026 entitled\u2026 to us all. I never regret choosing the path I did. I was Awoken to continue the search we started long ago. The quest for worlds worthy of our lives.\"\n\nPetra turns her back and goes.\n\nHe stares after her. Only after a long minute does he understand: She cannot say any of the things she wants to say and cannot bring herself to tell the lies she should. So she refuses him.

It feels like the respectful thing to do. There's a big coiled ammonite fossil right under the thin topsoil, though, and he knocks his forehead on it. The pain and the blowing sulfur dust make him sneeze.\n\n\"Humbly I come,\" he says, almost laughing, \"to speak to thee.\" Ikora said this was the place. Io. A world still half-born, connected as if by an untorn umbilical to the Traveler. \"I wanted to say\u2026 thank you.\"\n\nHe finds he's looking up at Jupiter. He's accustomed to seeing the Traveler above the City, so he fastens on the nearest huge floating sphere as a proxy. He forces his eyes down to the soil again. \"Thank you for what you did to Ghaul.\"\n\nIkora tells him if you listen with the right ears, you can hear the Traveler's last conversation with Io. As if the matter of terraforming an entire moon with Earthlike gravity and a biosphere is only a matter of rhetoric and instruction. Well. Isn't that the challenge, in the end? Not just assembling the power to do something, but convincing people to do it? No, not even that\u2014not convincing or coercing (Traveler knows he is tempted sometimes), but teaching them how to think as you think, how to value what you value, even giving them the ethics required to understand your valuation. So that you can trust them to make the choices you would, even when you're not around to father them.\n\nZavala wishes he were half as good a teacher as he is a Titan. Then maybe he could allow himself to relax a little and let others take care of things.\n\nExcept last time he let his guard down\u2014last time he dared think they were triumphant, with Oryx repelled, SIVA contained, Vex befuddled, Cabal huddled in their bunkers and too stubborn to come out\u2014Ghaul turned up in a storm and nearly destroyed the City, the Traveler, and everything Zavala loves.\n\n\"Did I fail you?\" he asks the bone-coiled dirt. \"Am I\u2026 the reason you had to wake up? Because I couldn't stop Ghaul by myself?\"\n\nIn the giddiness of victory, he declared this their new Golden Age. But now he thinks he may have misunderstood the Traveler's awakening. He has always, he hopes, been a brave man. But he is almost too afraid to ask this next question. \"Is this just our next 'age of triumph'? Is something worse on the way?\"\n\nThe bruise where he head-butted the fossil throbs. History, Zavala once told someone, is a question of armor. How much can you survive and keep on living? More than this, more than what's hit them so far.\n\nBut how much more? And if the next escalation is a consequence of the Traveler's awakening, will it be Zavala's fault?\n\nDuty is a puzzle. The harder you work, the more it seems to weigh. That reminds Zavala of Basho, his favorite poet, and of the hot spring Basho once visited to see the Murder Stone, which killed birds and insects that came too near. He has a horrible idea of the Traveler as that stone, surrounded by buzzing flies all shaped like Ghosts\u2026\n\n\"You're doing it again,\" his Ghost warns him. \"I know that expression.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Zavala says. \"I just worry.\"","name":"Pilgrimage","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":86503867,"index":550,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"86503866":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Spider's lair.

This reminds her too much of that awful day.\n\nSo when the voice comes through the door, she calls, \"Hold. Hold.\"\n\n\"Paladin Dinna?\" the Prince of the Awoken calls. \"You know that's my throne you're guarding, don't you? May I come in?\"\n\n\"You're not alone,\" she shouts back.\n\n\"I have my retinue with me.\"\n\nA few of Dinna's people lower their weapons. \"Weapons up,\" she snaps. \"We can't trust him to\u2014\"\n\nRoyal overrides slither through the throne room's networks. The doors open, and a dazzling barrage of flashbangs plays the royal welcome. Dinna stares straight into it, weapon aimed, eyes open, trusting her helmet to buffer her sight\u2014and waiting for the first blue flash of Fallen weapons.\n\nPrince Uldren Sov saunters in like the belle of the ball, his cocked revolver aimed at the ceiling. \"At ease,\" he says, with a little swish of his cloak, and everyone, Dinna included, responds. Just a moment's weakness. Just the subtlest flicker of deference, because he is the Prince and it feels so right to have royalty in this throne room again. Fingers off triggers, weapons skewed a few degrees off target\u2014\n\nThe impulse is so strong because it jives with Dinna's discipline, which has already stepped in to crush the immediate instinct to blow Uldren away. Something's wrong. Something's off.\n\nBaseline Humans can react to a visual stimulus in less than two hundred milliseconds. Awoken, less than a hundred. But there is a phenomenon Dinna and every other Royal Guard knows well, a trick of the mind called attentional blink. You are waiting for something to appear: a hostile, a gunshot, a loud noise. When it does appear, your attention blinks. You cannot detect a second event if it comes just after the first.\n\nSo it is with the blue flash of Arc-rifle fire behind Uldren's cloak.\n\nIt could go differently, still. But there is no one in this room who can easily sight in and fire on their Prince\u2014and he has no such reciprocal inhibition.","name":"King's Wrath","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/ecef59f299e69ca85afa43e11a687967.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":103281444,"index":554,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"103281445":{"displayProperties":{"description":"the clever one sees through our pawn\n\n'I am not your pawn.

That we needed to be together, or neither of us would be whole.\n\n\"Like soul mates?\" I asked. \"Because I'm not in love with Osiris or anything. Not only would that be really weird, he kinda gets on my nerves a lot of the time.\"\n\n\"It is not a romantic attachment,\" O said. If he had eyes, he would have rolled them at me. \"It is my belief that the Traveler understood that normal people would not be enough to protect humanity. That it would take those who are extraordinary in both body and spirit.

What is the magical heart of the process? Are we like the City's probability kilns, twisting the quantum vacuum in our favor to yield matter?\n\nPerhaps. Perhaps. But certain members of a cult I shall not directly name have their own specific interpretation of this process. \"When you bring him back,\" they told me, \"you must have a template\u2026 an image to provide you with the information you need. Where do you find that template?\n\n\"Simply in a neighboring timeline. A place where he is still alive and intact.

I had traveled these dead and dying worlds for longer than I cared to remember, all the while in search of a spark worthy of ignition.\n\nOver time I'd grown weary, but in this small band of survivors, I found hope. If I couldn't find a lost soul worthy to be touched by the Light, then I would find another way, a smaller way, to be of service. I would lead this small gathering of desperate men, women, and a single child to the growing sanctuary beneath the Traveler.\n\nIf I could not find a hero to challenge the Darkness, I would be a guide to those in need of salvation.\n\nIt took some time to gain their trust.

The attack had been swift and brutal. Twenty dead. Only nine survivors, here, in this cave. I watched the tree line, anxious and afraid.\n\nThe mother's pain filled the space between the thick trees. I turned back to her and saw it for the first time: the child's spark.\n\nFaint. But there.\n\nThis little boy was not my charge. Those selected to return were champions. This child was so small, so frail. What devotion had he shown? What bravery? What had he sacrificed? But a thought lingered\u2026\n\nWas it not my purest purpose to deliver hope? Every hero raised fought not for themselves but for the whole of humanity. If saving one life\u2014if redressing this one terrible loss\u2014was not a worthy cause\u2026 what was?\n\nI watched the mother as she cried.\n\nI felt myself expand.

A child, returned. And with him, the beginning of my journey's end.\n\nDid I do the right thing? Would the child grow to reach his peak physical self? Would he, like all returned, be ready for the wars to come?\n\nBut then a thought came over me, one I had never before considered: maybe death would have been better.\n\nHad I saved the child, or doomed him?\n\nAs his cries echoed, the survivors looked on in shock. There was joy in their silence\u2014wonder.\n\nI looked down on him, and pride began to well inside of me. I had done what was right.\n\nBut that was then\u2014only months ago, but long enough to seem a lifetime.\n\nNow the Fallen are back, and we are running.

But I had to do what I had to do. Some risks, after all, are worth taking. It was now or never.

Instinct, as it turns out, is a compelling motivator. She was up in a flash, sprinting away from the rig's burners and away from the gnashing teeth that were quick on her heels.

The other War Beasts closed in.\n\nThen\u2026\n\nMy Guardian\u2014this woman only just reborn in the Light\u2014grabbed the Beast clamping down on her arm by the hind legs, Lifted, and brought her entire weight down on the creature's spine, knee first.\n\nThe sound\u2014cracked bone and a sudden, sharp yelp\u2014caused the other Beasts to halt and the Cabal to quell their laughter.\n\nShe resumed her charge. No hesitation. The Beast's limp body was still locked on her arm. She pulled it free\u2014I could hear the flesh tear, but she did not flinch. Instead she closed the distance, rushing the Cabal, the Beast held tight in her good arm's grip.\n\nThe Cabal raised his weapon, but too late.

The Traveler is our primary, our mother, the primordial and the pinnacle. A dear friend, the Ghost of Pujari, once compared the Traveler to a song that has never been sung\u2014\n\nPEACH: Look, the answer no one likes to give is that no one knows what the Traveler is or anything about it. Not even us.\n\nBALTHAZAR: We know she wished for us to raise Guardians to be her avatars and defenders\u2014\n\nPEACH: Do we, though? Just because we CAN do that doesn't mean we were MADE to do that. And who says it's a \"she\" anyway? Why does \"it\" need a gender?\n\nBALTHAZAR: The Traveler, in her omniscient wisdom, looked into the past and the future, and from all the generations that emerged from the cradle of Earth, she chose the best of them to be her champions. Each Ghost was lovingly and carefully created for their one true Guardian. The Ghost and Guardian complete each other.\n\nPEACH: If that's true, then the Traveler's kind of a jerk.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Excuse me?\n\nPEACH: Look, I know tons of Ghosts who died before they ever found their Guardians. I know some Ghosts who still haven't found a Guardian. You haven't. And I haven't, but I don't think I'm \"incomplete\" because of it.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I have the humility to recognize my own shortcomings and to submit myself to the Traveler's plan.\n\n\nQ: Do you remember being inside the Traveler?\n\nPEACH: No.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I do. We call it the Womb.\n\nPEACH: I have never and will never call it that.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Imagine a cosmos inside a bottle. Trillions of stars orbiting each other in a complex weave. But they aren't stars. Perhaps a better word would be\u2026 souls. Souls, dancing in an infinite space enclosed within a celestial egg.\n\nPEACH: Which is it, an egg or a womb?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It's called a metaphor.\n\nPEACH: Well then, pick a metaphor. Not twelve.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Well, what would you call it?\n\nPEACH: I wouldn't call it anything, because I don't remember it, and I don't think you do either.\n\n\nQ: Some people say that each Ghost is an aspect of the Traveler\u2014that is to say, that each Ghost represents a part of the divine Whole.\n\nPEACH: [loud laughter]\n\nBALTHAZAR: Would you please? This is unbecoming.\n\nPEACH: First of all, that wasn't a question. Second of all\u2026 [more laughter] Third of all: if I'm a part of the Traveler's brain or soul or whatever, then the Traveler sure isn't divine, I'll tell you that much.\n\n\nQ: What will you do if you never find a Guardian?\n\nBALTHAZAR: I shall find a Guardian. The Traveler has willed it so.\n\nPEACH: Did you get that in writing?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It is true that some Ghosts die before finding their partners. If that happens to me, then I suppose I will \"do\" nothing, since I will no longer be. But I have faith.\n\nPEACH: If I never find my Guardian, I'll go steal someone else's. I hear Sagira had a good time with that.\n\n\nQ: If you could eat, what would you eat first?\n\nPEACH: Finally, a good question!\n\nBALTHAZAR: We do not know the desire for food. Our semicorporeal form\u2014\n\nPEACH: Nectarines. Or hot sauce. Ooh, or crickets. Crunchy roasted crickets. Crunchy food sounds so fun. I wish I could get cricket carapace stuck between my teeth.

He has taken the name Andal Brask, and I believe he will be trouble.\n\nPerhaps all this travel has made me sentimental, for when one of my Ghost wards finds their Guardian, I am sad, because my pack grows smaller. I miss them when they are gone. Now I am down to one Ghost other than my own. Pup, we call him. The runt of my metallic litter. Pup has yet to speak, but always his little blue eye searches for his Guardian.\n\nI plan to resupply at the Cosmodrome and then take Pup north. Those steppes are uncharted territory, except by that lone wolf, Conar. My correspondence with him is regular in the outbound direction; I consider myself lucky when he answers every fifth message. Still, you and I both know his intel is good. No one else knows Old Russia like he does.\n\nPerhaps in the Cosmodrome I will find a ship capable of breaking atmosphere. Though there is much of this Earth I have yet to see, I have come across more than a few Ghosts who believe their Guardians are offworld, waiting in the Golden Age ruins of Freehold and Ishtar and beyond. Some of these little Lights have decided to brave the null on their own to reach their fated partners. I tell them there's still so much of Earth we've yet to sniff out, that perhaps their Guardians have not yet been born, but some of them are convinced. If my next Ghost pack wants to make the journey, I am determined to join them.\n\nThese last few months we've enjoyed the pleasant absence of Cyrell.

And then I see it: a burnt-out building, the only man-made structure for miles. I do not know whether to fly faster or keep a stately pace. It doesn't matter. The dead cannot see.\n\nI am nervous. Why am I nervous?\n\nAs I draw closer, I rehearse what I might say. First introductions are important. \"You are a child of the Traveler's Light,\" I say to myself. \"You have been chosen in defense of this solar system\u2026 No. No. Hm. You\u2026 We are both children of the Traveler. You and I are both children of\u2026\"\n\nI forget my words as I slip into the building. I find meteorological equipment. I find an empty office. I find a dingy breakroom. At the back of the breakroom, I see my other half: a Fallen Vandal crushed beneath a toppled refrigerator.\n\nI am devastated. I have seen the Fallen. They are butchers. Castaway murderers. I would take anyone, but not this. Not this thing.\n\nI turn away. I count seventeen slow laps around the room and then another four around the building. I should be decisive, shouldn't I? I should be filled with pride that I have fulfilled my first purpose. I am not. It doesn't matter. I cannot ignore the pull.\n\nI return to the breakroom. I do not know what I will say, but\u2014Fallen or no\u2014it is the Traveler's will that I do this. I reach toward the Light, then reach toward that pull to join them together.\n\nThe refrigerator trembles as the Light suffuses him. I hear a low groan. \"Push it away,\" I whisper. If my Risen dies beneath this refrigerator and I fly away into the sun, no one will know. Perhaps I will have done the Earth a great service. \"I'm here with you, but you must help yourself. Push it away and sit up.\"\n\nThe refrigerator shifts, then topples to the side. An Awoken man sits up and pushes the dead Vandal off his chest like an unwelcome blanket on a hot summer night. With effort, he wiggles free and stands straight.\n\n\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asks. He looks around, then down at his blue hands. \"What am I?\"\n\n\"I am your Ghost,\" I say with more than a hint of obvious relief. \"You are one of the Traveler's Chosen, a defender of humanity. What is your name?\"\n\nHe flexes his fingers, works his jaw, blows a raspberry. Then he looks at me. \"Savin.

At first I took his flights of fancy as playful enthusiasm\u2014frivolous aggression free of consequence, a means of honing his focus and skill in advance of the dangers to come.

His mind\u2014unsettled. His truths\u2014unfettered by fact, unbound by reality.\n\nHe had named the Wood, as he had the Howling Hills, the Dead Man's Crevasse, the Gorgon's Maze. All mundane landscapes marked as hazards to be conquered, enemies to be slain, as he weaved a mythic tale of his own grand\u2014and as I would find, delusional\u2014design.\n\nIn the Hills, he slaughtered wolves; he called them Hounds of Hell. In the Crevasse, he burned the remains of long-dead \"survivors\"; he called them Foot Soldiers of the Necro-King. Down in the Maze, he covered his tracks so that the Stone Mother would not\u2014could not\u2014follow.\n\nHe did all those things and none, because none of those things were true outside of his fraying mind.

The Hunter noticed him, he was sure, but said nothing. Variks, for his part, was silent. Watched as he lost a few thousand Glimmer and a sidearm to one of Spider's bodyguards.\n\nCayde spun a knife in his right hand and sighed dramatically. \"If we're going to talk, you're going to buy me a drink.\"\n\nThey found a quiet place at the end of the room. Cayde settled back in the booth. Waiting.\n\n\"You do great service to Reef, yes?\" Variks worked hard to keep his very recognizable voice down. It would be a shame for his vocal synth to malfunction and blare out across the room now. \"Capture Barons. Criminals. For Awoken. For Petra.\"\n\nCayde took a belt and set the glass down on the table, empty. Something hard around his eyes. Amazing how expressive Exos could be. \"Get to the point, Variks.\"\n\n\"Fikrul. The last Scorned Baron. He lives.\"\n\nCayde's horn cut an arc through the air as he shook his head, twice, definitive. \"Trust me. He's dead. Put a hot one right through here.\" He poked Variks right in the center of his chest.\n\n\"Seen on Earth. I have knowledge. I have information. You know Eliksni have ways. Like Mithrax? Like Taniks?\" The warden realized his error as soon as the name was out of his mouth.\n\n\"Don't you EVER mention the name Taniks around me, got it? Not unless you want to lose your last two real arms. We're done. Get. You're bad luck.\" The Hunter stood, made to leave. Variks reached out and grabbed the Vanguard by the arm with one of his mechanic hands.\n\n\"I am sorry. I spoke poorly. Please. Listen.\"\n\nCayde shrugged off the arm and stood, towering over the Fallen for once.\n\nVariks sat up straighter in the booth. \"Take me to Zavala.\" The Titan Vanguard's name was a punctuated, flowing stutter in his mouth. \"I have information. He will like what I say. You for bringing me to him.\"\n\nCayde blinked. \"You want me to take you to the City? No way, bug. Not in a million\u2026\"\n\nWith a thud, Variks dropped the hand cannon he'd been hiding in his cloak on the table: a dull brown, bristles out the top, Ethertech trigger and muzzle assembly. Cayde's eyebrows went up in surprise.\n\n\"A gift of trust. Memento of the Reef. Upgraded, yes? Very deadly.\"\n\nThe Hunter Vanguard tried to hide his excitement. \"Is. Uh. Is that the last one? I haven't seen one of those in\u2026\"\n\n\"One of the last. Not many left.\" Variks' voice was even, calm.\n\nCayde snatched the weapon from the table. Checked the sights, spun it in his hand for a moment, feeling the weight. Grunted, satisfied. Nodded.\n\n\"Like I said: bad luck. C'mon.

He prepared the two empty cells and ordered extraction Servitors into place, all the while reveling in the thought of the judgment of Fikrul.

My friend.\" Was that tenderness Variks heard in Petra's voice? \"He is changed. His eyes\u2026\" She stopped herself. Reset. \"If he speaks, don't listen. He speaks lies. Terrible lies.\" And with that, she walked away, Cayde close behind. The doors to the cellblock slammed shut behind them.\n\nVariks stood there for a long, long time. For the first time in his life, he didn't know what the next step should be.\n\nPetra Venj and Uldren Sov had long admired one another; there was an easiness about them when they were together, and a deep if unspoken affection. When the two of them joined forces in the field of battle, they were quick, effective, and dangerous. Theirs was a dance of death, and woe to the foe who met them in open combat.\n\nVariks wondered for what crimes Petra would have Uldren judged. As he reopened the prince's cell, he wondered if Petra would have Variks himself judged.\n\nVariks knelt before Uldren. \"We thought you dead.

He checked every seal of Fikrul's cell, then gathered enough courage to peer into the porthole.\n\nFikrul was unaffected. If anything, he looked stronger than he did before. He stood there, glaring, a devilish grin plastered across his face. \"Does it find my Ether\u2026 bitter?\" he growled.\n\nIndeed, Variks could see that something was wrong with this Ether. It was darker, tainted with something he could not identify. He tightened the seals of his mask as he examined the Servitors' remains, fearing whatever they pulled from Fikrul could be toxic. He moved through the fog-like gas as if it was water. It didn't dissipate like traditional Ether;  it lingered, heavy and opaque.\n\nVariks stepped back up to Fikrul's cell.

Unfortunately, this meant that every menial operational task was left to him. Meal distribution. Waste disposal. Between the eight Barons and the Awoken prince, his new chores left him little time for Judgment.\n\nThrice per day, he visited the block. And thrice per day, he had to manufacture excuses to the local Corsair detachment for why the lowest level of the prison was now off limits. Rumors swirled. It was not unknown that Petra and Cayde-6 had smuggled some unknown high-value prisoner\u2014a humanoid prisoner no less, a first for the Prison of Elders if the rumors were true. But Variks assured anyone with the gumption to ask that his Judgment of the Scorned Barons was a sensitive process to be conducted in private.\n\nPetra herself did not help extinguish the scuttle. She was less than adept at the art of secrecy, and everyone knew it. She responded to any bold queries with a stern, \"It is none of your concern,\" which itself was tantamount to a validation that some version of the rumors was true. If only she'd found joy in her Techeun training; if only she'd learned more from the Queen.\n\nEach time Variks performed his rounds, he asked himself what loyalty\u2014if any\u2014he owed to the prince. And each time, he stopped short when he bore witness to the prince's\u2026 ramblings. Today was no different.

I know you want to hear it.\"\n\nVariks answered with a single, drawn out, and ever-so-slight nod.\n\n\"Your Kell lives,\" Uldren whispered. He leaned in a little closer and asked the one question Variks had never been able to answer: \"Do you know where your TRUE loyalty lies, Variks?\"\n\nUldren didn't wait for a response.

It was here, in the deepest catacombs of the Prison of the Elders, where he thrived, where he worked to rebuild the Eliksni. This was his home now, this workspace where he was free to explore the \"potential\" of the prison's inmates for future leverage.

Finally, he had a private conversation with the prison's sole remaining High Servitor: The Prison of Elders would not go without a warden.\n\nHe did not speak to Petra.\n\nBy the end of that day, the Prison of Elders descended into chaos.\n\n\"Your time WILL come, Variks.\"\n\nUldren sits in his favorite spot, gazing in his favorite direction. \"She told me so.

On the screens, Variks could see explosions resonating through the Prison. His former charges running rampant. His ship passed through the bay's barrier and began to move off.\n\n\"Nowhere else to go. No one else to be, here.\" He drew himself up to his full height. \"And so I become Variks, the Kell.

All I'll say about it is\u2014\n\nOnly one thing scares me more than dying, and that's dying inside these walls.\n\nBut I made a promise to my home.\n\nI took the three new Guardians for a tour of the tallwalk today. Two of them are blue. Actually, truly blue. I can't stop staring. Their names are Therin Vai and Nadiya. The third is an Exo, Lee-4.\n\nTherin noticed my staring and laughed at me.\n\n\"Never seen anyone this good-looking before, have you?\"\n\n\"Never seen anyone blue,\" I said.\n\nTherin tried to explain about Awoken. He didn't know much. He doesn't remember anything since becoming a Guardian.\n\n\"Then how do Guardians pick their names?\" I asked.\n\nAccording to Therin, Exo Guardians usually remember their names, but that's it. Awoken and Human Guardians remember nothing, so they just pick new names.\n\nSo I asked them why they chose theirs. Therin puffed out his chest\u2014his armor looked like it had once been really fancy, but it was scuffed and dirty from the road\u2014and said, \"Because it sounds awesome! Remember the name Therin Vai\u2014it's the name of the Guardian who will find the lost Warmind Rasputin!\"\n\nWhen he said that, Lee-4 managed to look exhausted, which is impressive for an Exo.\n\nTherin talked about Rasputin and the Baikonur for a while, so to sidetrack him I asked Nadiya where her name came from. But she just rolled her eyes. \"I don't think Micah's paying me to chitchat.\"\n\n\"You're getting paid?\" Therin said.\n\nLee-4 elbowed him hard.\n\n\"Ow! What was that for?\"\n\n\"To remind you why we're here,\" said Lee-4. It was practically the first thing I'd heard her say.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" I asked.\n\nShe fixed her electric eyes on me. \"Old debts.\"\n\n\"To Micah?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nNadiya slouched against the tallwalk parapet, her head flung back to hang over the side. I thought about pushing her over. \"Good luck with that, whatever that means,\" said Nadiya. \"I'm all about new debts. Preferably other people's debts to me.\"\n\nJust then Lee-4 swung the sniper rifle off her shoulder so fast it almost cracked Nadiya in the head. Lee-4 fitted the scope to her eye and held the weapon perfectly still, without even leaning the barrel against the wall. A pause filled only by Nadiya's complaints\u2014and then Lee fired off a shot.\n\nOn the horizon I saw a shadow fall.\n\n\"Fallen?\" said Therin.\n\n\"Kings,\" Lee confirmed.","name":"The Sixth Coyote","hasIcon":false},"subtitle":"\"You wanna use your old name, that's fine by me.

But when they took my Ghost\u2026 Ooh, when they took my Ghost from me\u2014that was the moment their lives ended.\n\nThey just didn't know it yet.\n\nSince my first rez, I kept to myself. Figured I'd always been that way, in my previous life and all. Joining fireteams, raiding, the Commander's Nightfalls\u2014never my bag. Always walked alone. Never needed nobody. Except for Ghost. Ghost was my only friend. Got no shame in admitting that, not anymore.\n\nNot long after the Taken War, we'd made our way to the EDZ, looking for a place to call our own. Looking for some quiet. Maybe something resembling peace. Ghost and me, we'd been fighting since the Faction Wars. Always fighting. Non-stop fighting. And I was done. We were done. We'd been running solo ops so long, I don't think anyone even noticed we were gone. And we were glad for it.\n\nOur sudden disconnect from the Light changed all that. Like it or not, I was Guardian, he was a Ghost. Peace was never in the cards; the Traveler saw to that. Ghost reconnected to the City networks for the first time in I don't know how long only to find that comms were jammed planet-wide. So we moved west\u2014to our original LZ, to head back to the City, to find the next fight. That's when they found us. The Cabal\u2014Red Legion, we would later learn.\n\nThey marched us north of the Winding Cove. Set up camp within sight of the Shard. They ingested their libations. Got rowdy. They knew we were Lightless; they wanted to see what I was really made of, when I was just meat and air. I said, do your worst. And they did. Beat me within an inch of my final life and then guffawed when Ghost couldn't do anything to get me back on my feet. They ingested more of their bevvies, and one of 'em decided I had one eye too many, and he took it and popped it and laughed some more and asked me what I was gonna do about it. I laughed back, louder and crazier than they liked, and told them I had another. Then one of them, the worst one of them, took hold of Ghost, and said, I'm your Ghost now\u2014I'm the one who decides if you live or die. Ghost was just a pebble in its meat hooks. And with no effort at all, Ghost was in pieces. Before the sun rose, they threw me off a cliff. They should have put a bullet in me. They should have fed me to their War Beasts.\n\nFigure Ghost chose me because I was some kind of hero in my before time. Maybe.

First it was a Skiff. Then another, followed immediately by a third. And finally, a full-blown Ketch de-cloaked above their position. There were but three of them to protect a hundred who had once been thrice that. Within minutes, it was only her.\n\nShe corralled the survivors into a cave that once upon a time wasn't a cave but more of an industrial drainage system. It was foul here; the radiation was practically palpable, and the survivors\u2014if they survived this day\u2014would likely find their lives shortened by years if not decades thanks to this poisoned solace.\n\nShe pushed them forward, deeper into the underground, as fast as they could manage. She carried two children, both eerily silent and unaffected. They, like their people, had endured more than she could imagine in their five-thousand kilometer exodus. They had given up their homes for the promise of something better. For the promise of hope and light and the strength of the pack. In their quest for better lives, they had lost almost everything.\n\nHer Ghost told her the bad news\u2014this cave system was a labyrinth extending dozens of kilometers with more dead-ends than not. The walls were deeply reinforced, and its scans could see but half a kilometer at best. It was going to be trial and error, and their pursuers were getting closer. Her Ghost didn't think they would make it. Not before\u2026\n\nOne of the children in her arms\u2014a little girl whose name was Violet\u2014looked her in the eye and told her, without a hint of doubt, that she knew her Guardian would let nothing happen to them. Not after how far they'd come. She smiled at Violet and told her, yes, everything was going to be okay.\n\nShe set the children down, told them to run ahead and join the others; she would be right behind them. Alone with her Ghost, she told it to lead them to safety. She would stay behind and buy them time. And by the Traveler's Light, it would be an eternity's worth.\n\nAnd so, reluctantly, her Ghost floated ahead to rejoin the exodus, but not before swearing it would come back to find her and bring her back, no matter how long it took.\n\nWith the light of her Ghost now out of sight and the soft wet steps of a hundred refugees out of ear-shot, she strapped on her helmet, tightened her gauntlets, and drew a line in the muck beneath her feet.

Now the little caf\u00e9 tables were barricading the doors and the counter's glass case had been smashed into a far wall with the display racks.\n\nThe militia Exo she'd borrowed the comms unit from snapped off another few shots over the half-wall that remained on the shop's exterior. They looked back in her direction, anxious. \"Can you fire a weapon?\"\n\nHer helpless look must have been an answer, because they reached out for the comms unit. She slid it across the floor, and they quickly punched in a sequence of codes. Another blast nearby caused the other civilians in the room to whimper and moan with fear.\n\nThe Exo barked into the unit. \"We need Guardian support, corner of the 1400 block Anchor District! I have a large number of civilians here, and our position is being overwhelmed!\" They punctuated their transmission by leaning out and firing off another half dozen shots. The Cabal roared back in animal fury.\n\nIt wasn't more than two minutes before Eva heard it: the distinctive sound of a Sparrow, running full-out. She dared to gather herself into a half crouch and peer out of the building. She was watching just in time to see a pair of them, a Hunter and a Warlock, descend on the invaders like vengeful angels. These two were professionals, she could tell\u2014no swagger to them. They were efficient and deadly, and the soldiers began to fall back.\n\nSomething happened. Eva couldn't see what it was, but both of the Guardians reeled. The Warlock dropped to one knee, like his strings had been cut. The Hunter shook her head and raised a hand in the air, a distinctive signal, calling for the Light\u2026 but nothing happened.\n\nThe Cabal, like they'd been waiting for this moment, struck hard. The Hunter was bowled over by a charging Centurion and crushed underfoot. The Warlock didn't seem to ever really recover, and he fell to the ground, riddled by the weapon fire of a dozen soldiers.\n\nThe Exo was standing fully upright now, shocked, and even as Eva opened her mouth to tell them to get down, they fell\u2014a sniper's target.\n\nOne of the men retched in the corner, horrified. Eva gave herself no time to think. She snatched the comm unit from the ground and pushed past the civilians to a far window. She used the reinforced case to smash out the glass and began hoisting children through once the largest shards were cleared of the frame. She was the last out of the building, and a few stray bullets plucked at the wall near her as she made her escape.\n\nThey didn't stop running until they were sure no one was following. She had no idea which district they were in, no clue even what the building used to be. Much of the orderly streets and well-tended boulevards she knew had become a maze of debris\u2014the last safe City, a maze of collapsed and ruined structures.\n\nThe children were huddled up in a great pile as the older folk talked quietly among themselves. Everyone was crying, on and off, but they tried desperately to keep it quiet. \n\nA high-pitched chirp across the comm unit startled Eva, and she slammed her head back against the wall behind her. She hadn't even realized she still had it. She reached down and keyed the pad.\n\nA hushed voice said \"Ma'am?\"\n\nHer own voice low and shockingly gruff, she answered, \"This is Eva Levante. Is this Tozzi?\"\n\nA pause. \"Tozzi's dead. She wanted me to make sure someone got back to you, though.\" Another long pause. Eva fought the urge to scream. \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Levante. Block 10 is just gone. I think some of the automated defenses managed to come online early in the fighting and one of their command ships must have crashed\u2026\"\n\nEva didn't hear the rest of the words.","name":"Loss of Light","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075524,"index":842,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075525":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Eva checked the time on the small comms unit she clutched to her chest. It seemed impossible, but it had been under two hours since she'd been sitting and laughing with Tess. Time had stretched for her, like the taffy candies some of the vendors sold during the Dawning festival. She would have sworn it was days ago. Longer than that, when she'd been sitting in her cousin's flat, hugging Valentina. Saying goodbye to Luis\u2026\n\n\"Eva, we don't owe them anything.\" A gruff cough, one of the other civilians. Everyone's voice was a grinding imitation of itself; ash filled the air, and no one could clear their throat.\n\nEva clasped a rag to her mouth as she answered, croaking. \"How dare you?\" Her voice rose with her anger. \"Your whole life they've kept you safe, and now you want to just abandon them?\"\n\nThe subject of their dispute lay collapsed on the floor of the warehouse. A quartet of Guardians, all of them wounded and bleeding from within their flamboyant armor. Even as she weighed the future of their little band, she couldn't help but appreciate their fashion sense. The Hunter, of course, had put in the most effort.\n\nThe man arguing with her was paunchy and fashion-illiterate, wearing a bland functionary uniform: part of the Consensus staff. He scowled at her and grated out, \"We can barely move the lot of us around, let alone all of us and a bunch of wounded, powerless Guardians. Why should we risk our\u2014\"\n\n\"You don't think they've risked their lives a hundred times over for you?\" She pulled the rag away from her face and coughed a mass of phlegm and ash to the side. Her mother would have died all over again of shock. \"We have to keep moving, we have to keep them with us, and we have to hold out. Whatever this is, it's temporary.\"\n\nHe grimaced, but she pressed on. \"When they regain the Light they'll\u2026\"\n\nHer diatribe was cut short by a blast of static on the comm unit, so loud she dropped it on the floor. The reinforced case took the blow, and so everyone around clearly heard the deep voice of Commander Zavala when he began to speak. \"Citizens of the Last City. Hear my words.\"\n\nLike a people dying of thirst, the civilians moved in to circle the comm unit. Zavala had been a pillar, a beacon of hope all their lives. Surely he would\u2026\n\n\"We are abandoning the City. We have evacuated everyone we could, but the Cabal now hunt Guardians in the streets. If you are able, you should make for the wilds.\" Eva felt as if she'd been physically struck.\n\n\"The Cabal have affixed a device to the Traveler and severed our connection to the Light. We cannot hold the City, and we cannot protect you.\" There was a long pause, as if he was weighing his words carefully. When he spoke again, Zavala sounded very, very tired.\n\n\"We are setting a rally point elsewhere in the system\u2014watch for a broadcast. We will return to the City someday, but\u2026 I do not know when.\" Another pause. \"Be safe. Be brave.\" And he was gone.\n\nTo their credit, the group did not yell or shout. Even though it had only been a matter of hours, they were all alive because they'd learned not to give away their position. They did cry, though. Tears streaked trails down faces covered in ash; those faces looked from one to another as they sought to understand, to comprehend.\n\nEva did not cry. As she stared at the comms unit, all she could think about were Zavala's shoulders. She'd often joked with him about the size of the pauldrons on his armor, that massive protective plate on his left shoulder. And now\u2026 for some reason, she thought she understood. The weight on his shoulders\u2026\n\nEva stood, and all eyes turned to her. She flinched a little. Then, choosing her words carefully: \"Most of them are leaving. So we have to help them.\" She gestured at the Guardians. \"If we can keep them alive, they can protect us, keep us safe.\" She looked around the group, found people nodding.\n\n\"Where do we go?\" one woman asked.\n\nEva looked back down at the comms unit. \"The Cabal will have heard that. They'll be watching the walls, expecting us to try to leave.\" She looked up, out at the room. \"So we stay here. We make for the edge of the City and try to find somewhere the Cabal won't expect us to be.\"\n\nThe seamstress reached down and pulled up the comms unit, slinging it over her shoulder. \"Everybody up. It's a long way to Twilight Gap.\"","name":"Hiding at Home","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075525,"index":843,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075522":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Just getting to the outskirts of the City was an ordeal. Every day, they saw the Cabal's control tightening. Civilian groups or the odd Guardian tried make a break for it only to be brought down by a swarm of ships hungry for a kill. The streets were no safer, with patrols moving in tandem and tanks rumbling through district centers.\n\nYears of supporting the Guardians, of listening to their idle chatter, had filled Eva's head with details about these horrific invaders. She realized they were doing rigid block-by-block sweeps, unimaginative and plodding. Just as described at the Tower.\n\nTheir group hid and observed and moved only when the Cabal did. In that careful manner, they arrived at the far reaches of the City\u2014parts long abandoned, where Humanity was just a shadow cast upon the walls.\n\nEva found herself in consultation every day, organizing foraging patrols back toward the center. Evenings were spent suggesting strategies for the upcoming days.\n\nAnd to her great satisfaction, she spent nights sitting with a needle and thread, trying to make sure the survivors would stay warm on the move.\n\nAs the three Guardians recovered (they lost the Titan on the way to the Gap), they started offering more guidance. At their suggestion, the survivors never stayed in the same place more than a day or two. They posted lookouts every night and turned on the comms unit only every other day to listen for broadcasts. For chance transmissions. For hope.\n\nEva was there in the room when the Guardians heard Zavala's voice\u2014his short, terse statement played over and over. \"If there is any Light left in the system\u2026 we rally on Titan.\"\n\nShe shut the door so the other civilians wouldn't hear and listened as they had it out. The other Warlock, Tam, identified herself as Trinh's sister. They were adamant that they try\u2014somehow\u2014to get offworld and head for Titan. The Hunter, Ramos, was just as adamant they stay.\n\nTheir discussion wound down and came to a slow stop with all three Guardians looking at her. She held up her hands and said, \"I trust you all to do the right thing.\" They stayed. And quickly became integral to the success of their\u2026 operation.\n\nWhat had begun as simple survival became an organized effort to evacuate civilians from the Last City. Foraging parties inevitably came back with more people than they left. Scouting parties probed the edges of the City and found avenues of escape, places where the Cabal were lax in their patrols.\n\nEva found that the same skills she'd used to plan holidays at the Tower were invaluable in organizing this underground movement. She cobbled together boards from old classrooms to create a schedule and wrote on the backs of old forms and newsletters to make \"delivery packages\" of civilians and the occasional Lightless Guardian.\n\nDay in, day out, this became her quiet routine. She faded into the background of the Underground: plan, move, sew, repeat. Even when contact was finally made with the Farm and getting survivors to the EDZ became the goal, Eva was always there making sure the trains ran on time.\n\nAfter some thought, she asked that her role not be spread around. She got word to people like Tess that she was alive, and that was enough for her. She had the chance to get out of the City dozens of times.\n\nBut every time she thought she'd take that exit, go with that convoy, she stopped herself. Settled back. Did the work.\n\nThat was how the months of the Red War passed for Eva Levante.","name":"The New Normal","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075522,"index":844,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075523":{"displayProperties":{"description":"\"Abuela? Ma'am?\"\n\nIt was quiet, almost a whisper, but enough to wake Eva. For a spinning, disorienting moment, she thought she was sitting in her living room back in Peregrine district. Her favorite afghan over the end of the couch and Carlos standing over her\u2026 but that wasn't Carlos.\n\nThe concerned face of the Hunter, Ramos, looked down at her. More than a few of the Guardians that went through the Underground had taken to calling her grandmother, but Ramos had stuck with the group through all the long months of the war.\n\nHe was very protective, sometimes smothering, and she sighed as she rubbed at her eyes. \"I'm up. I'm up. What time is it?\" She sat up on the old couch she'd been sleeping on, wincing as she tried to sort the knots she'd developed sleeping on her side.\n\n\"Almost 0700?\" His voice was low and a little sheepish.\n\nShe glared at him. \"You were supposed to wake me an hour ago.\"\n\nHis grin was lopsided. \"You needed the sleep.\"\n\nShe stood carefully and tottered on unsteady legs, turning her face away so he couldn't see her annoyance. \"Are they waiting?\"\n\n\"They've only just arrived. One of the reasons I waited. They're not expecting you for another 10 minutes.\" Trying to justify himself.\n\nEva sighed again. \"Thank you, Ramos. You're right; I did need the sleep. I was up again too late last night. Go tell them I'll be right down.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" He sounded happier, and his footfalls as he left the room were light, confident.\n\nEva stepped into the bathroom off the main living quarters of this second-floor flat. Her morning routine sorted, she poured some water out of one of the ration canisters into the stoppered-up sink so she could wash, try to feel a little less like she'd slept on a half-rotten couch in an abandoned building.\n\nWater dripping down her nose, she reached blindly for one of the pieces of scrap cloth they used for towels and dried her face. When her eyes cleared, she found herself looking at a stranger.\n\nEva had always been on the thin side. She could still remember her mother chiding her, telling her to eat and clean her plate. Now the woman staring back at her was positively gaunt. Bags under her eyes, hair chopped brutally short, and her clothes! The clothes she'd been wearing the day of the attack hadn't lasted two weeks, never intended for living rough. The homespun outfit she'd stitched for herself would never have passed muster back at the Tower, but\u2026 out here they had to do. At least she'd been able to salvage her trademark shawl. Something to remind her of better days\u2026\n\nAs she drifted into the living room, Eva reflected that better days, of course, were why the group was gathered downstairs. All of the Underground cell leaders gathered in one place for an important\u2014perhaps final\u2014conversation.\n\nFor the Underground, the Red War was a stunning victory. They'd won. The only civilians and Guardians left in the City were those unwilling or unable to go. Eva frowned, saddened.\n\nEvery few weeks they heard stories of a group of Guardians overrun from a supposedly secure bunker by a Legion assault. The loss of civilian life had been staggering, both in the initial assault and the intervening months.\n\nAs she looked down into the street through a slit around the boarded-up window, she had to admit to a feeling of\u2026 satisfaction. Now all that was left was for the Underground itself to pull out, make for the Farm and the safety-in-numbers of Hawthorne's group. Eva raised her eyes from the empty streets to the distant sight of the Tower, twisted and ruined.\n\nShe would stay, she had decided. Guardians like Ramos could check on her from time to time, but someone needed to stay behind and keep the lights on. There could be refugees still alive out there. Still hoping for a way\u2026 out.\n\nShe turned away from the window to head downstairs when the explosion ripped through the street in front of the apartment, and Eva's world turned white.","name":"The Good Fight","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075523,"index":845,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075520":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Eva, for the second time in as many minutes, shook her head and tried to understand where she was. There had been no warning. She'd heard a few seconds of a whining engine overhead, and then a massive explosion ripped through the street in front of the Underground apartment.\n\nThe blast had thrown her to the ground like a doll. Everything hurt, and from somewhere close by she could hear the guttural shouting of Cabal soldiers. The distinctive sound of Guardian weapon fire was answering. Someone was screaming.\n\nWithout thinking, she was on her feet, lurching toward the far corner where her shotgun lay on a side table. Three steps, four, weapon in hand and checked. Just in time as the apartment door flew open and a pair of Psions stepped through, weapons ready.\n\nEva Levante, seamstress of the Tower, would have been taken aback. The gaunt woman she'd just seen in the mirror had spent months dry firing the weapon. Endless drills had trained her for action and her first shot took the one on the right in the chest and blew him out of the room. It had not prepared her for the kickback, however, and she felt something crack in her arm as the weapon bucked against her.\n\nThat flinch saved her life as she unwittingly pivoted to the side, narrowly avoiding shots from the other Cabal creature. Roaring, she raised the weapon against and her answering blast threw him against the far wall.\n\nBreathing heavily, she reloaded the weapon with one hand and waited, listening. No more outside that she could hear. Fighting was fierce downstairs. They needed her. She stepped to the door, weapon outstretched\u2026\n\nThe sound of the wardog bursting through the apartment window was like another explosion. Eva whirled around as the scaly beast scuttled to the side, and another pair threw themselves from the hovering troop transport into the small living space.

The old nets were slack, now. Needed to be rehung. No one came by who cared enough to restring them, and the Farm's current inhabitants were not the sporty type.\n\nBeyond the field were the rolling hills of the European Dead Zone, and on the horizon the twisted, ruined spur that was the Shard of the Traveler. Her first days back on her feet, recovering from the attack at the apartment, she'd stared in wonder at that view. \n\nNow she watched the clouds idly roil and collect around the Shard, bored. Eva smiled, and shifted her weight off the wall and onto the carved cane that kept her upright. To think after everything that had happened, she could be bored.\n\nHer first days at the Farm had been a whirlwind of medical treatments, rushed through by attendants already on their way out as she was coming in. It had been the final days of the Red War, a major operation planned to retake the City.\n\nOne old woman coming in from the Underground was a low priority, and in the commotion even the old friends she'd hoped to see had missed her.\n\nNow, she was alone. Or, mostly alone. She turned her head to see the Cryptarch, Tyra Karn, chattering away with Farm's postal frame. With primary operations returned to the City, Darbi had become Tyra's unofficial research assistant. Together they continued to study and examine Humanity's history through the lens of the Dead Zone, a sideline from the turmoil at the Tower Tyra was apparently only too happy to claim.\n\nThe scout, Devrim, came by every once in a while for a chat as well. When he was feeling cheeky, he referring to their little group as the \"old hands club,\" usually smirking over the top of a cup of tea.\n\nBoth still had official jobs to do, of course, and they took their roles very seriously. \n\nEva was at the Farm very unofficially. Her role at the Tower had never been one vital to operations, of course\u2026 but no one had rushed to ask her back to the market, either. Tess and Banshee had reached out once in a while, and she'd given advice on how to set up their new space.\n\nBut Eva was here at the Farm for the lost. \n\nThey trailed into the place in ones and twos. They all shared something in common: the Shard hadn't connected with them. They came to sit and stare at it, off in the distance. To talk about how hard the Red War had been, as unpowered Guardians\u2014some forced by circumstance to literally sit on the sidelines.\n\nWhen the Light had returned, some of them reported that it felt different. It sat under the skin like a suit that didn't quite fit anymore.\n\nA diminutive Exo woman was one of the pilgrims Eva remembered most clearly. She hadn't even known they made Exos that short. The woman shifted and twitched as she talked, unable to calm herself. \n\nAt the mention of the Light fitting differently, a statement she'd heard a lot of Guardians make, Eva asked the same question she always did. \"So does that mean the Light is different now? Or are you?\"\n\nThe Exo stopped and narrowed her eyes, thinking. She was stock still for the first time since arriving at the Farm. \n\nThat was usually how it went. Sometimes asking the question was all it took to get them sorted out. Others took a lot longer, sometimes spending weeks at a time at the Farm just doing as Eva was: staring up at the Shard.\n\nSome\u2026 some came to the Farm, found no answers, and left on foot walking toward that great landmark on the horizon. So far as Eva knew, none of them had ever come back through the Farm.\n\nIt was a strange life. Another strange time, another role she'd never asked for. But she found she was good at it.\n\nAnd Eva Levante had no interest in returning to the City.","name":"Caretaker","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/d8dafc80a5bd195b22a680d097511a9a.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3558075521,"index":847,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3558075534":{"displayProperties":{"description":"The comms unit in her little room chirped loudly enough to wake Eva from a sound sleep. Eva had turned the little outbuilding into something of a homey space with use of fabrics and art scavenged from the Dead Zone, but as it often did when she woke suddenly these days, it took her a moment to remember where she was.\n\nShe groaned as she slid out of bed, using nearby furniture to steady herself. The damage the War Beasts had done had been extensive, and even now she could feel the tightness in her legs where the Bray tech had knit bone and sinew back together.\n\nShe slumped into the little chair in front of the comms unit. The light from the screen lit the room, which was otherwise almost completely dark. She blearily peered into the unit, as the image of Tess Everis resolved itself. It was daylight in the City, and Tess was impeccably dressed for work.\n\n\"Do you have any idea what time it is here?\" Eva asked, allowing the annoyance to seep into her words.\n\n\"Yes. I do.\" Something in Tess's voice made Eva sit up and look closer. There was a tightness to Tess's face. She looked\u2026 frightened.\n\n\"Tess, what's going on? Are you all right?\" Eva was wide awake now, and plucked at the edge of her teal robe to draw it around her. She was suddenly cold.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sweetheart. Just\u2026 wanted you to know right away. I bet Tyra's getting a call from Rahool right now.\" Tess looked down and away before looking up into the camera again. \"Sweetie, Cayde's dead. Something happened out at the Reef yesterday. I don't know all the details, but everyone's talking about it.\"\n\nEva's mouth formed a thin, worried line. She'd never been overly fond of the Hunter Vanguard, but so many people looked up to him. Relied on him. And if something was powerful enough to kill Cayde-6\u2026 \"The Legion?\"\n\nTess shook her head. \"Still quiet, as far as word around here goes.\" She gave a dim smile for the first time since Eva had picked up. \"You know how reliable the rumor mill is, though. It could be anything.\"\n\nEva sat back in her chair, frowning. \"I'm sorry, dear. I know you liked him.\" Tess shrugged, trying to play it off. \"Don't give me that, we weren't swapping stories in the Market that long ago.\"\n\nTess stopped, and nodded sadly. \"There's going to be a memorial service, I think. Will you come back for it?\"\n\nIt was Eva's turn to look away from the screen. It was the first time someone had asked her to go back. And for a funeral, of all things. Eva was about to make an excuse when Tess continued, her smoky voice taking on a light tinge of humor.\n\n\"While you're here you can sort out the holiday programming for the frames.\"\n\nEva's eyes widened. \"The frames are doing holidays without me?\"\n\nTess's smile broke into a full grin. \"We were just as surprised! Somehow all of the holiday gear got packed along with critical supplies in the transfer to the new Tower. And when your programs kicked in, they were able to find the tagged crates.\" Tess picked up her comms unit and angled the lens so that it would show the Dawning hat sitting on top of a mannequin in the corner of the room.\n\nEva shook her head, disbelieving. \"They did the Dawning without me.\"\n\nTess's face came back into frame. \"Over the summer, Ikora got someone to help her set up an event to commemorate the end of the War, too.\" \n\nEva tried not to let her annoyance show on her face. \"How was it?\"\n\nTess shook her head from side to side, evaluating. \"Oh\u2026 you know. OK.\" When she saw Eva's mouth tighten, Tess laughed. \"It didn't have your touch, sweetie.\" She sighed. \"Oh, it feels good to laugh. Come back to the Tower! Even if it's just to pay your respects. I haven't given you a hug in what feels like years.\"\n\nIn the darkness of her room, Eva turned to look out her window.

When it's clean, we'll start moving in the crates.\" The frames both nodded to her and beeped affirmation. They were already sweeping with abandon as they crossed the threshold. Eva stumped back several paces, supported by her cane, to avoid getting any dirt on her outfit.\n\nAround her, the marketplace swirled with activity. Civilians on break ate at the lunch counter, shoppers browsed the stalls, frames cleaned and patrolled and delivered goods, and Guardians were everywhere\u2014a riot of color and style as they flipped and floated and leapt around the space.\n\nEva scowled, frustrated with herself again for letting Tess and (to an extent) Amanda talk her into returning. None of this felt right, none of it felt\u2026 comfortable. And now this space they'd given her to store her wares had apparently last been opened and cleaned sometime before the Faction Wars.\n\nShe found a bench along one of the market's walkways and sank gratefully down, watching the crowd pass by. Fashion, as it always did in the City, had moved quickly since the day the Legion attacked. She was still catching up, still finding her footing. Rebreather masks in particular dotted the faces in the crowd, more stylish and ornamental than practical\u2014a holdover from a necessity in the days rebuilding and restoring the City.\n\nAnd the Guardians! Tess had spent much of their time together since her return filling her in on fashion trends among the Lightbearer set, and Eva was incredibly impressed. Tess, the foundries, even the Vanguard had outdone themselves. Armor designs and shader schemas had improved dramatically since her days at the old Tower.\n\n\"What am I even going to do here?\" she muttered to herself. \"What can I do that\u2026\" she trailed off, watching a Guardian walk by with what appeared to be a full crest rising above his helmet and a Warlock robe that flowed and rippled behind him in the breeze.\n\n\"That's it.\" Eva stood, heading for the door to tell the frames to stop cleaning, when someone stepped into her path. A Guardian in a leather trench coat, with a shiny black helm.\n\n\"Eva?\" The voice was distorted. She could see her own face reflected in the helmet, confused.\n\nThe gloved hands came up and the headpiece came off to reveal the smiling face of Ramos. \"Abuela! It's me!\" He pulled her into an enormous hug as she smiled.\n\n\"You rascal. You never gave me the chance to thank you.\" She swatted him kindly on the shoulder as she pulled away. \"Just save a woman's life and then ride off to retake the City, why don't you?\"\n\nRamos laughed, happier than she'd ever seen him. The Light hung around him easily, and he turned to a pair of Guardians who were standing nearby, watching tentatively. \"Team, this is Eva Levante! You remember my stories? This woman is a legend!\"\n\nHe gestured at the two. \"Eva, these two are shiny as Glimmer. Just became Guardians before the Legion attacked.\"\n\nEva nodded her head deeply to them. \"Good to meet you both.\"\n\nOne raised a hand in an awkward greeting, while the other cocked their head. \"What\u2026 do you do here?\"\n\nEva sighed. \"Oh, I'm not\u2026 I'm not actually.\"\n\nRamos laughed and said, \"She's a phenomenal seamstress!

Even still, it took some convincing, and full-on bribery, to eventually get hands on the tomes needed to crack the mystery of the arcane texts.\n\nThe books and writings we secured from the tradesman were incomplete and mostly scholarly guess-work. But there were enough translations and competent theory to provide a foundation for own interpretations. \n\nIt wasn't long before the pieces started to fall into place. We still had much to learn, but we were certain of a few key ingredients: Yor had been to Luna\u2014whether his corruption began there or led him there was still unknown\u2014and the glyphs he'd etched spoke of a great \"unmaking,\" the truth of which would be our own.\n\n\u2014hand-scrawled note accompanying Teben Grey's personal translation of ancient Hive text","name":"VII: Joining","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/7df076a912716ef4c429d3fb77fa504d.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":614571559,"index":865,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"614571560":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I.I\nThe whispers hear you\u2014some say they always have.\n\nI.II\nAll you have learned from the quiet words pales to the secrets you scream as your cages start to bend, as the old you starts to break.\n\nI.III\nThe whispers listen, the whispers learn.\n\nI.IV\nEvery shrill agony etches a map of the mortal condition. \n\nI.V\nEvery wicked cry adds to a vast tapestry of understandings.\n\nI.VI\nIn your pain the whispers find their answers\u2014to your worth. \n\nI.VII \nWhen the flesh is gone and only bone remains, there will be no secrets left to scream.\n\n\"Know pain, that it may teach you all you never imagined possible.\"\n\u20148th Understanding, 7th Book of Sorrow\n\n\n\"Unmaking.\" For the longest time, we thought it was a threat, but as our work continued and we deciphered more and more of the glyphs we came to see it as something more\u2014a promise.

Two more thunderous shots, and their drones were as dead as they were.\n\nI saw the glare from your scope disappear, and I knew you were heading away. I know you must feel guilty, but don't. It was I who wronged you.\n\nI grabbed the accelerator and got as far from the shouts of the aggressors as I could. They've been on my tail.

If you want to know about your past, know that you were born a second time in the Niobe Labs. When you were wounded at the labs and I saw you were losing your fight, I did what I always did when the chips were down: I\u2026 created something. You, Ada-1. From what I had almost completely lost. I did it out of fear of losing you forever. I charted the course of your life and made decisions that were yours to make, not mine.\n\nI hope you find it in your heart to forgive me for that.\n\nI was na\u00efve. Looked too often to the past. I just couldn't let any of it go. I never did have much respect for the natural order of things. And Helga, well\u2026 she was the opposite of me. She only wanted to grow the Armory, to see its full potential. And Yuki helped make that vision possible. The two of them spent as much time looking ahead as I did looking back.\n\nI realize now that there's a balance to life. You look backward a little, you look forward a little.

Then I said, Eva, these traditions are bigger than you. They live in the hearts and minds of the people who have passed them on, generation after generation!\n\nNow I am back in the Tower, helping to create the loveliest Dawning celebration yet. And I carry on a tradition I am sure to repeat every year: I ask Ikora to make the Dawning Crystal, and I ask until she does it.\n\nI make an appointment to discuss the decorations, but I know she's always very busy with urgent Vanguard business. That is why, when I approach her alcove and hear low voices, I don't barge right in; I just peek a little bit.\n\nIkora is muttering\u2014she sounds almost angry. \"Dawning decorations! I've got no time for frivolous\u2026\"\n\nA male voice says, \"It is not 'frivolous.' People need this. I understand that it's hard for you because it's the first Dawning without Cay\u2014\"\n\n\"Stop talking, Ophiuchus. Right now.\" I do not see who Ikora is talking to or recognize this name, but Ikora's voice is sharp. \"I have other concerns. What about the latest reports out of the Tangled Shore? I don't know what to make of them. And my Hidden have reported trouble brewing closer to home\u2026\" I notice her eyes drift across the main passageway, to a secluded nook with a partially closed gate.\n\n\"Yes, Ikora.

Ikora watches me, her arms crossed. Her Ghost hovers by her ear, whirring with alertness.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Ikora Rey!\" I begin. She can tell by my big bright smile and the firm way I spread out the designs for her to pick from that it will go faster if she says yes. She respects our tradition, though; she says no twice, then she says fine, Eva, fine. She does not believe the crystal matters, though; she avoids my gaze, but her Ghost\u2014I see his eye blink at me.\n\nThe design she promises to make is exquisite.\n\nWe agree to meet again when she finishes it. I join her in the Bazaar while running errands with my assistant Malia\u2014so many last-minute tasks! When we march up, Ikora and her Ophiuchus are huddled together. She keeps shaking her head. But still she lifts her arms, and suddenly an enormous Dawning Crystal winks into being in the skies above the Tower, like a million diamonds suspended in air.\n\nMalia gasps. She has never been so high in the Tower, nor seen the Dawning Crystal up close; only from the City far below. She drops all the packages she was carrying.\n\nThe Warlock Vanguard helps Malia pick them up, piling one parcel on top of another until she realizes Malia is still as stone, kneeling, watching her, watching her hands that had kindled light from air. The poor girl's scarred face is slick with tears, and she wipes them with her sleeve, but the tears will not stop. Malia's family escaped the City during the Red War, you see; though they survived and have a home again, there have never been many beautiful things in their lives.\n\nMalia touches Ikora's arm and mouths a thank-you.

Nora had been on the road since she was a girl, sometimes with nothing more than an old scribbled map and that shotgun of hers. She didn't need much, but she did need people. Nora met Amanda's father in some half-abandoned village, and when she told him about the Last Safe City, well, he followed her. They had no family but themselves. They picked up fellow refugees on the way. Lost others.\n\nThen they had their precious little girl. It must have been a slow, slow road\u2014first with a little baby, then with a young child. But they believed. They had hope. They pushed on.\n\nAmanda told me about one particular Dawning they had shared out in the wilds. They had fallen in with another family that had a child, Lucia, a bit older than little Amanda. They were agreeable travel companions. They found themselves in the thick of the forest, with the wind wailing, a storm coming down, branches flying\u2026 and realized they had to stay put.\n\nSo, they find the wreckage of a dropship, lean up a wing and crumpled siding, and squeeze all the grown-ups and the two little ones into the dry space under the rusted hull.\n\nThen Amanda's mother says, \"We'll be here a while. Might as well do something to keep our spirits up.\"\n\nShe sends the adults out foraging for something to eat, something to drink, and something to keep dry. Amanda's father comes back with long-leaved plants to weave into mats. Their companions return with full water flasks, some prickly fruit, and a dozen or so wild vegetables like cucumbers. With dried fish from their packs, it is quite the feast.\n\nAs the adults are working, Lucia is curling the rinds from the fruit into little flowers, but little Amanda is kicking her legs, restless. \"Make yourself useful; make some decorations,\" Amanda's mother urges her. She hands Amanda wires and nuts and bolts and a circuit board full of little lights.\n\nLucia comes jumping, an old battery in her hand. Together the girls make miniature garlands of tiny bulbs. And Lucia shows Amanda how to touch the wires to the battery to make them light up. Bright little lights in the vast dark forest.\n\nAmanda told me about the fruit, with soft white flesh and a sour taste. She told me about how they sang made-up songs together with no words, just humming and tapping out a beat on the metal walls of their shelter.\n\nShe doesn't know what the fruit was. Maybe it does not exist anymore. The other family? They got separated from Amanda's people. Later on, Amanda's parents\u2026 gone, like so many others on the road to the Last Safe City.\n\nBut Amanda Holliday still makes the lights, you know.

So, I go to see Banshee-44 to sort it all out.\n\nThe Exo has no recollection of a delivery. But he recognizes me, and I notice his eyes glow a teensy bit brighter. \"Must be about the Dawning,\" he mumbles, and he turns on his heel and heads straight to some shelves at the back. He returns with two big boxes.\n\n\"These them?\" he asks.\n\nWe open the first one up. Inside, we find a very, very old box of chocolates. Many different portable kits for cleaning weapons. A copy of \"Hunter of the Heart\" (I know this novel, but it is not for everyone). A necklace with a bullet pendant, tucked with care into a little box. Stacks and stacks of Dawning greeting cards.\n\nI shake my head gently. \"Those are presents people have given YOU for the Dawning, Banshee!\"\n\nThe Gunsmith blinks a couple of times. Then, he closes the carton\u2014I worry he should have thrown away the chocolates, but maybe next year\u2014and then turns to the other one on the counter. He lifts the cover.\n\nIt is full of Dawning gifts, wrapped in brightly colored paper and tied with glittery ribbon. Some are in tiny boxes, but some are guns, of course. They are all meticulously labeled.\n\n\"I think these are the presents you are giving out to friends this year, no?\" I ask with a wink.\n\nBanshee gives one brisk nod as he turns over the labels, reading them. I observe that some have detailed instructions. The Exo shrugs.\n\n\"Got in the habit of writing everything down. Sometimes I\u2026 I don't always remember.\" He waves the thought away. \"Right.\"\n\n\"I still need my supplies? The boxes I came to get?\" I nudge him.\n\nHe tilts his head a moment and finally raises a finger. \"Oh.

Suraya Hawthorne is one of those people. I know her brusque attitude can be off-putting, and that's intentional on her part. But once you get past that, there is so much to learn.\n\nShe was orphaned as a young girl, and Devrim and Marc took her in. Honestly, I think having these two as role models is part of why she's as strong as she is. They raised her to be sure of herself and to always do what she thought was right\u2026 even though that ultimately led to her having to leave the City.\n\nAs Suraya tells it, she came home one day to find Marc and Devrim sitting at the kitchen table, as though expecting her. They had her sit down, then asked if there was anything she wanted to tell them.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Nope.\"\n\nMarc asked her to try again, but she was silent, so he told her that Executor Hideo had stopped by their home. She asked how he was.\n\n\"You know how he is,\" Devrim said. \"Tell us what happened.\"\n\n\"His face got in the way.\"\n\nMarc took a deep breath and said Hideo claimed to have caught her stealing supplies that morning, and did she have anything to say about that? She did not.\n\nHe reminded her that stealing supplies and breaking a faction leader's nose were both good ways to get kicked out of the City, and Suraya could keep quiet no longer. She almost shouted her explanation: The factions didn't care about the people who needed food and supplies\u2014the people who could not pledge to a faction because they were too busy struggling to survive. She wanted to help them, so she would sometimes steal supplies from New Monarchy.\n\nDevrim asked, \"What about Hideo?\"\n\nSuraya rolled her eyes and groaned, explained that when Hideo had found her, he'd said all manner of nasty, evil things to her: She was worthless, she was nothing, things like that.\n\nDevrim agreed Hideo was\u2026 well, I won't repeat it, but suffice to say it means \"an unpleasant person.\" He held a lot of influence, though, and he was insisting Suraya be punished. Harshly. For Suraya's part, this seemed to crystallize something. She tells me that's the first time she knew she wanted to leave the City\u2014that perhaps this had been part of why she'd punched Hideo. She told her guardians and they couldn't believe it.\n\nThey were quiet for a bit. Then Devrim broke the silence. \"Well, let's get packed.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Absolutely not.\" She was not about to let her decisions hurt these men who had taken her in and cared for her. They'd done nothing wrong.\n\nOh, they fought her. As she tells it, they argued a long time, until finally, she shrugged and said, \"If you try to come with me, I'll run away.\"\n\nShe suspected they knew there was no bluff to call, as they spoke now in tired, worried voices, making their case one last time. Suraya was adamant. \"I won't let you suffer for my choices.\" What could they do?\n\nShe asked when she had to leave. Marc said he could hold off Hideo for a day or two so they could all make a plan. His voice became stern again, and he said, \"You're going somewhere close enough that we can come and check on you as often as we like. At least for a while. That is nonnegotiable.\"\n\nHe had no negotiating power, of course. But Suraya had agreed. She stayed very near the City for over a year before saying proper goodbyes and heading out further into the world. \n\nSuraya Hawthorne is, in my mind, the definition of doing what you think is right regardless of the consequences. She knew it was right to help struggling families, she knew it was right to not put Devrim and Marc in harm's way, and she knew it was right to give them some peace of mind by staying close.

We need more of those, you know.\n\nWe talked many times about the war, and he tried so hard to convince me to arm myself. \"You've seen what's out there,\" he would say, as though I might have forgotten.\n\nWe argued about it time and time again. I had jobs that didn't require fighting, I would explain, and that was intentional. My strongest contributions lay elsewhere, and I meant to keep my focus there.\n\nI remember one conversation in particular where Devrim was absolutely adamant. \"Eva!\" he finally said, louder than I think he meant to. His eyes were urgent, almost angry, as they locked on mine. \"This isn't some 'what if' situation. You've already had to defend yourself. It stands to reason you'll have to again. The Cabal aren't backing down, and they're not the only threat. To know all that and still not even try to protect yourself\u2026 it's irresponsible.\"\n\nYes, I had defended myself. And I had hated everything about it.\n\n\"Devrim.\" I kept my voice soft, but my words clear. \"The fighting, the shooting, the mayhem\u2014that's not what I want to be part of. I've seen enough. If it comes for me again\u2014and I agree, it could\u2014then so be it. I want to be part of the healing. I want to be part of what builds us back up.

Old habits, as they say.\n\nWhen I finally came back to the Tower, though, what do you think was waiting for me? The Dawning festival was just beginning, and the Postmaster had a package for me. Inside, a beautiful sidearm\u2014ornate design, antique coloring\u2014and a note. From Devrim, of course.\n\nAt first I was indignant\u2014after all our conversations! I had half a mind to simply throw this gun away. Instead, I read the note.\n\n\"Eva, my friend!\n\nI was sorry to hear you'd left the Farm after all, but very glad to know you'll be among dear friends. In that spirit, and in the spirit of the Dawning, I wanted to offer you this gift. This has been passed down through my family for generations.

We tried decorating the railings outside our Command Center with the garlands, but the Fallen have been using the lights for target practice. I guess we'll be getting some more next year and prettying up the break room instead.

Seeing as the room is exposed to the elements (the glass view window broke long ago, but repairing it just hasn't been a priority), Del and Ari had to bundle up\u2014and we had to weigh the tablecloth down with chunks of metal. I've had worse setups.\n\n\"Eva, it was the best meal I've had in ages. That chicken? Delicious. Every one of us got to try a piece. We cut our protein rations into fun shapes, and once we got your taffy warmed up enough to chew, it was heaven.\n\n\"We exchanged Dawning gifts as well. Somebody even cross-stitched me an 'inspirational quote' to hang in my quarters ('Where's my beacon?'; it's an in-joke). Decent tools, Heavy ammo, thick socks\u2014those are the kinds of gifts that change hands out here. Maybe that doesn't impress people accustomed to the Dawning in the Tower, but those presents have worth to us.\n\n\"When we joined hands afterward, whether for warmth or just conviviality, we got to talking in a way we never really had before. I don't think I've ever voluntarily shared stories about myself in my life! We talked about who we were before the Red War, where we came from, and even where we might want to go in the future.\n\n\"It's not easy here on this storm-tossed moon\u2014one jolt and you're tumbling off a platform into eternity. Between the Fallen and the Hive and the elements, we're always just struggling to stay alive. But as we sat there chatting, we FELT alive.\n\n\"I guess I wrote all this just to say thank you, Eva, for reminding us to take a moment to appreciate and rejoice, no matter what. I find that inspiring.\n\n\"Sincerely,\n\"Sloane\"\n\nI have never left Earth, and Titan sounds like a\u2026 very interesting place.

It sounds to me like one of them is always happy, and the other is always sad. That's no way to live for either of them. These things must exist in balance. I know they're computers, but I worry for them.\n\nOne Guardian in particular spoke to me recently of the time he told the Failsafes about the Dawning festival.

Why do you celebrate being cold?\" Then the sad one said, \"I mean, I can't feel cold, but it sounds awful.\"\n\nSo this Guardian said something like, \"It's more that we're celebrating each other,\" which I love, because that is how I've always thought of it as well. We're all here together, eating sweets and being with each other.\n\nThe Failsafes asked a few more questions and then the happy one said, \"If we are celebrating each other, how can I participate in the Dawning?

He seemed unaware that the Dawning was taking place, in fact. But I explained, and when I told him it would be\u2026 very well regarded if he wrote her a Dawning greeting card or went to visit her, he said he could write a card. He also said he had a Dawning gift for her.\"\n\n\"Oh! How kind!\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" she sighed and produced a piece of parchment.\n\nIt was folded in four to form a greeting card.

I don't know if she's any more cheerful, although she did say, 'Ah yes, I had been expecting these notes for some time now. Good.' She even wrote a Dawning message back to Asher.\"\n\nIkora handed me back the same piece of parchment that her scribe colleague had used, but it had been refolded. I read, \"Asher: Take heed not to succumb to the whispers, as fools do. Warmest wishes to you this Dawning! \u2014Eris Morn\"\n\nI shrugged.\n\nThe Warlock cleared her throat. \"Eris also had a Dawning gift for me to pass on to Asher.\"\n\n\"At least she's making an effort.\"\n\n\"Well\u2026\" Ikora hauled me aside and took out a small, lumpy packet wrapped in cloth. She peeled back the layers of tissue with care. And there it was. The Dawning gift glowed with a sickly green luminescence.\n\n\"I can't give this to him!\" Ikora hissed. \"I can just...\" She looked around for eavesdroppers. \"...get rid of it, right?\"\n\n\"This is beyond a question of Dawning etiquette,\" I whispered back.\n\nShe nodded, her face set. \"Let us never speak of this again.\"\n\n---\n\nRadiolarian Pudding:\nMix Vex Milk and Electric Flavor, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"A Cautionary Tale","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3056981400,"index":903,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3056981401":{"displayProperties":{"description":"It's not only my customers who keep me running about.

Eva Levante does not tattle about sensitive matters.\n\nHe was carrying a formidable piece of weaponry, a complicated curve of many metal parts with a thick string connecting the ends. \"It's a compound bow,\" he explained, following my stare. \"For shooting arrows.\" I raised my eyebrows in puzzlement.\n\nOn that weapon, he had placed a large pouf of red velvet ribbon. A bow on a bow.\n\nI could tell from the tilt of his helmet and his taut grip on the weapon that something was amiss.\n\nI sighed. I saw this a few times every Dawning. I suspected he was smitten, and this would not be a short conversation.\n\n\"Warmest Dawning greetings to you, Torito!\" (That is not his actual name, naturally; it is a made-up name.)\n\n\"Eva Levante. They say you should give a Dawning gift when you\u2026 have a special friend,\" he boomed, trying to whisper.\n\n\"Who is 'they'?\" I laughed.\n\nHe ignored me. \"I bought my friend this bow.

Today it was a woman. A beautiful, sturdy Guardian with dark, cropped hair and a diagonal stripe of white across each eye\u2014very striking! She had a satchel slung over one shoulder and a stack of books and packages cradled in one arm. By this, I guessed she was a paying customer. She also had a cheeky curl to her lip and a hand on her hip, and she tap-tap-tapped her fingers as she waited. By this, I guessed she was a Hunter.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Miss\u2026?\" I greeted her.\n\nShe launched right in. \"Can you help me put together a really small, intimate Dawning celebration? Do you have, like, a kit or something?\" she asked, peering back over her shoulder with impatience. \"It's a surprise for\u2026 somebody who's used to the Dawning in the City, only now we're all the way over on Mars, so\u2026\"\n\n\"Ah! Well, the Dawning basics are decorations, shared food, and gifts. First: you have a choice of lanterns\"\u2014I pointed to the colorful spheres lining the shop\u2014\"and candles\"\u2014I produced a box of tea candles from under the counter and thumped it down in front of her\u2014\"and streamers.\"\n\n\"Candles and streamers are a fire hazard. I'll take candles and lanterns.\"\n\n\"Silver and yellow lanterns go well together\u2026\"\n\nShe squinted up at my display. \"Purple.\"\n\n\"I'll give you purple, green, and silver. That's a pretty combination. The Dawning is about wonder and beauty, so you don't buy just one lantern.\" I stacked the accordioned lanterns on top of the candles.\n\nShe opened her mouth and then shut it again. I pulled out my biggest assortment of Dawning treats and placed it on the counter. \"Sharing and generosity are the heart of the Dawning. This collection is the one you want\"\u2014here I paused\u2014\"if you want to impress someone you love.\"\n\nShe pursed her lips and pushed the beribboned package of sweets next to the candles and lanterns.\n\nSmiling, I pulled over a rack of my finer garments. \"Finally, the Dawning gift: the most important\u2014\"\n\n\"Oh, I've already got a good Dawning gift.\" She put her belongings on the counter to point out the necklace box on top. I also happened to scan the spines of the thick books, some with very long titles, all labeled, \"Fu'an Library \u2013 REFERENCE \u2013 DO NOT REMOVE.\"\n\nThe Hunter noticed my frown and shoved the books into her satchel. \"Here's what I picked. Think she'll like it?\"\n\nI didn't know who 'she' was. But I admired the necklace she was showing off: an elongated pendant with an emblem of a little bird, of exquisite workmanship.\n\nShe grinned, \"That design is Golden Age, but the pendant also holds thirty-five petabytes of data!\"\n\nI returned her smile. I also convinced her to buy a sturdy book bag and purple wrapping paper.\n\n\"There! Your own personal Dawning in a bag!\" I said, tucking away her Glimmer and handing over her purchases. \"I hope your companion enjoys the surprise.\"\n\nThe Hunter bobbed her head in thanks and turned to go.\n\n\"Anastasia!\"\n\nWho did I see then but Commander Zavala, standing arms akimbo in the corridor as the press of the afternoon shopping crowd flowed around him.\n\n\"Zavala,\" muttered the Hunter. She pushed her shoulders back and thrust out her chin; she looked fierce as a falcon.\n\n\"Happy Dawning, Ana. I'm surprised to see you in the Tower.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, I had errands\u2026\"\n\nBut I missed what else they said, because someone ran up with a package, asking, \"Hey, did I hear that woman was headed back to Mars? This one's going there, too.\"\n\nI ran my eyes down the packing list: candles, lanterns, candy assortment, wrapping paper, cloak\u2026 Ordered by a Camrin Dumuzi. I got a funny feeling, it was such a coincidence\u2026\n\n\"I think this is meant to be a surprise. The package can wait for tomorrow's deliveries,\" I replied.\n\nWhen I looked back, Zavala and the Hunter were deep in conversation, the Titan Vanguard wearing a half smile and the woman smirking.

The rarest form is genuine kindness, though there is also \"fair weather\" friendly, \"I want something\" friendly, and \"look how friendly I am\" friendly. That last one is always hiding something, and they hope their performance covers it up.\n\nThis last group is also where we find that man who calls himself the Drifter.

I've spoken to him only a couple of times. He always seems like he's in a rush.\n\nThe one conversation we've had beyond our introduction was very short, and he slinked away before I could get any answers. It was right before the start of the Dawning festival. I was getting my decorations set up as he walked up to my booth and asked, \"Well, what's all this?\"\n\n\"Surely you know of the Dawning?\" I said\u2014not in a rude way, but in a friendly way. \"I know you're a snake\" friendly.\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" he said. \"I guess I'd forgotten it was gettin' to be that season.

Why don't you tell me a thing or two?\"\n\nI may not be centuries old, my friend, but I am no na\u00efve child either. Old Eva knows a lie when she hears it. I spent a bit of time telling him about our festival anyway, explaining our traditions and the meanings behind them. He nodded along, seemingly very attentive. I tried to bring the conversation back to him.\n\n\"So, Drifter, where are you\u2014\"\n\n\"Well, best be on my way!\" he said, pretending not to hear me as he backed up. \"I've taken up enough of your time\u2014who knows how much any of us has left.\" As he walked off, he tossed back, \"Like the d\u00e9cor!

I missed my friends while I was away, and I thought about them every day. Even when you're doing what you know is right, it can be hard not to wish for times past.\n\nI've wanted so much to catch up on everything I missed, but these Guardians are so busy, always flitting in and out. You can barely get a word out of them most of the time. I feel like so much has happened, but I get only drips of information.\n\n\"Spider\" is a name I hear over and over, but who is he? A common criminal? A deity? A friend? Some accounts paint him as all three. What is it about this Spider fellow that compels these Guardians so?\n\nAnd do I have it right that he feeds on Ghosts? Ghosts! What an utterly despicable practice. Even the most detestable Ghost doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. (Yes, I am thinking of one in particular, but\u2026 I'm afraid old Eva will keep that secret to herself.)\n\nFrom what I can put together, this Spider fellow had a group of Barons, I think. If that's correct, his relationship with them seemed\u2026 tenuous. I don't know what one gets up to on this Tangled Shore, but I think he had them all killed.\n\nBefore that, though, Spider's Barons broke into some kind of high-security prison out in space. They were looking for\u2026 something belonging to Spider. I don't know what it was. Maybe it was Ghosts or maybe it was weapons\u2014although why he'd have someone look for those things in a prison, I don't know. While his Barons were in there, the prisoners started to fight them. That rascal Cayde-6 was also in the prison, on a mission that I don't think was related to Spider's mission. They ended up in the same fight, though, from what it sounds like. Then, while everyone was fighting, the Reef Queen's brother arrived!\n\nWhen I first heard this story, at this point I thought to myself, \"Oh, good! Finally someone on our side. The Awoken Prince will help get things in order.\" Now, keep in mind that I had always heard he was\u2026 a bit stiff. But also that he was willing to help when it came down to it. That was before his sister, though. Loss can do terrible, ugly things to us.\n\nThis leads me to the only detail I know with absolute certainty: Uldren Sov killed Cayde-6.\n \nI don't know why, but I suspect it was in part because the Prince succumbed to the pain in his heart and lost the ability to see things as they are. Anyway, once Spider's Barons left the prison, they ran all over the Reef. I guess they had found what Spider was looking for, but decided to keep those things for themselves. This Spider sent people after the Barons, and I don't think any of the Barons survived.\n\nWhile all this was going on, someone killed Uldren. I assume it was revenge for Cayde, but I can't get anyone to tell me with certainty who did it. Based on everything else I hear about this Spider, I wonder if Uldren wasn't also his work.\n\nMany of my Guardian friends are still doing favors for this\u2026 creature who, at best, betrays his own people. I am not sure that road leads anywhere good. Though perhaps I don't have the whole truth.\n\nThis is no history lesson. Take it however you will.

It's very confusing\u2014roped-together rocks? And you just\u2026 jump between them? It's no wonder that Reefborn Awoken are so often suspicious of others if they grow up unable to even trust the ground!\n\nBut the Awoken as a whole\u2026 I feel like my grasp of them has certainly grown, but there are things I still don't understand. They are certainly part of what we consider \"humanity,\" just as much as Humans or Exos. I know this and believe it, but what makes it so?\n\nIs it because they are\u2026 made\u2026 like we are? The Cabal are built roughly as we are, but we do not consider them part of humanity.\n\nIs it our shared relationship with the Traveler? As hard as it is to believe, I have heard the Fallen had a relationship with the Traveler. But they are not part of humanity. \n\nDoes \"humanity\" consider only those who choose to walk among Humans? But by that logic, Reefborn Awoken who remain in the Reef are not part of humanity. I don't believe that's true, and yet\u2026\n\nPetra has spent most of her life in the Reef, hasn't she? I know she was here playing Emissary for a while, but she has always considered the Reef her true home. Would she describe herself as part of humanity? I think if you walked up to Petra and asked, \"Are you a member of humanity?\" she would respond, \"I am an Awoken of the Reef.\" If you pressed her further and asked, \"Yes, but which side are you on?\" I believe she would say, \"The side of Queen Mara Sov.\"\n\nSo then is humanity something we choose? Or is it ascribed to you? Is it a title to be earned or a birthright, a heritage? Are the Awoken part of humanity due to one of these stipulations, or\u2014\n\nCould it be that the Awoken are part of humanity because of ALL of these stipulations? Individually, these ideas don't define humanity any more than a cloak defines a Hunter, but COLLECTIVELY\u2014that they are built as we are, that they share our relationship with the Traveler, and that many of them gladly walk among us here on Earth\u2026 Maybe THAT is what makes them part of humanity\u2014everything bound together, just as we are all bound together.\n\nThat togetherness is what helped us win the Red War, and I truly believe it will help us push back the Darkness for good.

It even seemed to be moving, gently flowing on its own\u2014but there was no wind.\n\nWhen the light hit his face, I screamed and ducked down behind part of my cabinets. I was sure this abomination had come to invade us, that more of them were just out of sight, that we were done for.\n\nEventually, I realized no one else was screaming. I heard no sounds of distress. I peeked out and saw that everyone was going about their business. No one was panicking but me!

Tess came over before too long, and I asked her about the strange figure.\n\n\"Oh, that's X\u00fbr!\" she said, unconcerned. \"He comes through every so often and sells particular, hard-to-find things.\" She considered him for a moment, then added, \"Could do with a bit of a wardrobe update, if you ask me, but he's otherwise harmless.\"\n\n\"What is he?\" I asked. \"I've never seen a creature like that before.\"\n\n\"X\u00fbr is\u2026 I believe he's called a Jovian.

I even began to appreciate his predictability\u2014it became a symbol that everything was functioning as it should.

It was a popular night for parties, so I was threading my way through the crowds on my weary old feet, enjoying the laughter and flushed faces of those I passed.\n\nA roar of many voices drew my attention to the open window of a large chamber packed with merrymakers. I asked myself, now who could that be, causing all that noise? Ay! Believe it or not, it was the Cryptarchs!\n\nThey were playing some kind of game, someone holding up an engram, people shouting out comical guesses about what was inside\u2014I don't know what Cryptarchs find fun, honestly. But I saw the door open and someone with a hood slip out very quickly and vanish into the crowd. I remember chuckling to myself, that's somebody making an escape, all right!\n\nBy now, many of the festivities were winding down, and the streets overflowed with oh-so-lively residents of our Tower. I could barely set one sore foot in front of the other in the press of people! So it was that I found myself almost shoulder to shoulder with the Cryptarch who'd fled the party. Even though he was pulling his hood down to conceal his face, I recognized him: Master Rahool.\n\nI wasn't the only one to do so.\n\n\"Hey Rahool, get any blues from a purple this Dawning?\" someone yelled, to a chorus of raucous laughs. I didn't understand, but he looked taken aback.\n\nThen, approaching from the opposite direction, some young people with that scruffy, bright-eyed look of students started tapping one another on the shoulder and pointing. They pushed one boy forward, and he stared intently at Rahool, scrunching up his face. The Cryptarch must have sensed the young scholar meant to accost him, because he tried to head the other way in the throng. No luck, of course.\n\n\"Master Rahool, Happy Dawning!\" I heard the youth begin. \"Me and my friends, we're just beginning our studies in cryptography, and we had this theory about Ulan\u2014\"\n\nAt this point, I told myself, Eva, you have to save him.\n\nI made a great push through the masses and hooked my arm into poor Rahool's. \"I need the Cryptarch's help!\" I chirped at the students, with an apologetic shrug. Then I hauled Rahool toward a side street. I may be petite, but after decades of walking through the City, I can move through a crowd when I want to.\n\nWe ducked through alleys and passages until I found an empty courtyard. \"I think we can wait out the crowds here,\" I told the Cryptarch, who gave a curt nod. My feet were throbbing at this point, so I threw myself down on a bench, removed my slippers, and began to rub my aching soles. Rahool stood there staring at his own feet like he was contemplating the infinite universe.\n\nFinally I looked around to get my bearings. \"Oh!\" I exclaimed, pointing. \"Turn around, Cryptarch!\"\n\nRahool followed my gaze. Above our heads, strings of shining globes and jewel-colored lanterns traced bright lines across a sky of deep-blue velvet. Below us stretched the twinkling lights of the City. The soothing curve of the Traveler was just visible.\n\nRahool seated himself beside me, and we settled into an amicable silence, with only the occasional rustle of a Dawning banner whipping in the breeze to break the calm. My feet gradually ceased to ache.\n\nFinally, after minutes or hours, I stood and slipped my shoes on again. \"I must go home and sleep,\" I told him, raising a hand in farewell. \"I think the streets will be empty now.\"\n\nThe Cryptarch's face twitched in what I imagine was an attempt to smile. \"Happy Dawning, Eva Levante.\" he managed.\n\nWhen I departed, he was seated still, hands folded neatly on his lap and a serene face tilted toward the heavens.\n\n---\n\nBurnt Edge Transits:\nMix two ingredients that do not successfully combine, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"Celebrate in Your Own Way","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3073758982,"index":910,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3073758981":{"displayProperties":{"description":"","name":"","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3073758981,"index":911,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3056981392":{"displayProperties":{"description":"I've known Zavala a long time, you know.

We exchanged some brief pleasantries, and\u2026 I don't remember what I said that brought this on, but suddenly he said, \"Oh, that reminds me of a joke!\"\n\nA joke! At first I thought I must have heard him wrong, because the Titan Vanguard had always struck me as the \"no time for joking\" sort. But he had barely begun telling this story before I noticed how much more relaxed his posture was. It seemed the spirit of the Dawning had reached even this stone man.\n\nI remember only pieces of the joke these days\u2014I believe it had to do with a Guardian and a Fallen Captain?\u2014but I clearly remember that he stumbled over the first few words and had to start again. I gave the warmest smile I could to encourage him, and he went on to tell one of the longest, most awkward jokes I have ever heard. And listen, I loved every minute of it. Truly, I couldn't have been happier. Oh, I clapped and laughed along with what I swear was real, true joy from Zavala. To have such a guarded soul open like that\u2014few things are more beautiful. I admired him so in that moment, that he could push himself beyond the boundaries he'd held himself to. I remember hoping that I could someday be so brave in my own way. For the first time, I didn't just respect him as one of the City leaders. For the first time, I felt real, genuine affection for Zavala, the person. Zavala, my friend.\n\nHe has been dear to my heart ever since.\n\n---\n\nGjallardoodles:\nMix Ether Cane and Delicious Explosion, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.","name":"Lighter Days","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/4351e3fe33c75c7f2a0a8003440ab9a5.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3056981392,"index":912,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"2417017736":{"displayProperties":{"description":">>CLARION RETINA BURN>>\nV330CRF104MES492\nAI-COM\/RSPN: ASSETS\/\/WARWATCH\/\/IMPERATIVE\nCONTINGENT ACTION ORDER\n\nThis is a WARWATCH ASSETS IMPERATIVE (NO HUMAN REVIEW) (secure\/AUTARCHY).\n\nStand by for CRITERIA:\n\nUnder CARRHAE WHITE\nIf [\u03b8] is INACTIVE and UNRECOVERABLE\nIf event rank is SKYSHOCK: OUTSIDE CONTEXT and CONTEXT is CRONUS\nIf VOLUSPA is ACTIVE and PRIMED [[synapse to DVALIN::ABHORRENT]]\nIf YUGA is ACTIVE and in ECLIPSE\nIf a CIVILIZATION KILL EVENT is predicted [[E<0.005]]\nIf tactical morality is built at MIDNIGHT\n\nExecute DECISION POINT:\n\nActivate LOKI CROWN\n\nCancel counterforce objectives\n\nActivate NAGLFAR STEP\n\nActivate KALKI GOLEM\n\nExecute ALL ASSETS IMPERATIVE ACHAEA KNOX (unsecured\/OUTCRY) at SM CALADBOLG\n\nBegin transfer.

I'm a little beat.\"\n\n\"OK,\" she said, shrugging. She left.\n\nGermaine opened a small box of water from the pile of ration packs and poured a tin-full. Yu hadn't noticed because it was difficult to see in the flickering lamplight, but his hands shook.\n\n**\n\nJudson's breath steamed in the night air as he shut the gate that bordered town as quietly as he could. Shivering would mean shaking the rickety thing and waking up Yu's family, so he kept the handle gripped tight as he pushed it back into place. He now stood on the pass out of Eaton Valley.\n\nAs he turned around, he walked right into Germaine.\n\n\"Didn't see you there, brother,\" Judson growled low, stopping just short of throwing an elbow into his neighbor's throat. He backed up a step. Just one.\n\n\"Where're you running to this late?\" Germaine asked. \"Brother.\"\n\n\"What are you, dense? Away from this before the shooting starts.\"\n\n\"We gotta trust this Lord Dryden knows what he's doing,\" Germaine said.\n\nJudson shook his head. \"You and all the deal-makers are gonna get this town dead. These guys are worse than the stories.\"\n\n\"You know how I feel about Risen, but they saved us this week.\"\n\nJudson sneered. \"No one ever believes it 'cuz Risen look like you and me, but they'll kill you without meaning to. Naturally as breathing. They can't help it.\"\n\n\"They're lookin' to jump one man. Just one. We gotta see this through. Even the Risen can contain a fight at that scale.\"\n\n\"You gonna move? Or do I move you?\"\n\nGermaine stepped to the side. \"I'm not the law. But where you gonna go? There's nothin' but war-land out there. And their prey is comin'.\"\n\n\"I'm a tracker. Kept this town fed for years before you got here. I'll be fine. And that other Risen won't care about one man passing through. I got nothing to hide. Just need to get away. If you all want to play bait for the warring dead, have a nice life.\"\n\nGermaine chuckled.\"What's funny?\" Judson sneered in that low voice again.\n\n\"I don't know how you do it. I almost admire you.\"\n\n\"How's that?\"\n\n\"You've got no fear. Have a nice life, brother. See you when I see you.\" Germaine walked back to the gate.","name":"Home, pt.

Half the town came out to see them.\n\nOne of the men wore red armor that fit the description of the Warlord that Dryden and his Lords were waiting for.\n\nThey say that one Risen, reasonably armed, can annihilate an army. Two Risen, assuming adequate cover for Ghost support, can fight infinite armies indefinitely.\n\nSix Warlords dismounted their machines in a line at the center of town, weapons drawn. They dropped Judson on his knees in front of them. No restraints. He looked unhurt.\n\n\"Does anyone want to claim this runt?\" asked the Red Man.\n\n\"We will,\" Germaine said. People groaned. Yu tried to run to Judson, but her parents held her back.\n\n\"A question, first,\" said the Red Man. \"Where are the Iron Lords? We saw one of their Ghosts. One of these?\" He tapped the bladed carapace of his own drone companion as it floated past him, its eye fixed on the townspeople. \"They like to meddle. Maybe they helped you, brought you some food? It would explain how you survive out here in this wasteland. But I can guarantee you their motivations are not in your best interest.\" The Red Man paused, scanned the crowd as his Ghost orbited above him.\n\n\"The Iron Lords are trying to disrupt the established order. And we're here to liberate you from them. You're under our care, now. So. Where are they?\"\n\nGermaine shut his eyes a long moment. When no one else spoke, he decided he would. \"You're right. They were here. But they're long gone. We paid them for supplies and they moved on a week ago.\"\n\n\"Did they?\" The Red Man raised his hand cannon and shot Yu's father in the head. The entire crowd flinched and huddled together as the man fell backward. Yu's mother cried out in fury, but held her child tight.\n\n\"Hand to my heart,\" Germaine said, holding his breath as he waited for the hidden Iron Lords to make a move. The Red Man held his gun in the air, watching the townspeople intently. The other Warlords scanned the horizon, gleaming weapons at the ready.\n\nJudson took the pregnant pause as an opportunity to pull a Fallen shock blade from one of the Warlord machines. He gave a triumphant yell and decapitated the armored Risen closest to him. As the body fell, he jabbed the length of the blade through the Red Man's back. A third Warlord pulled the glaive out of Judson's hands and stabbed him in the side with a gauntlet blade, then hurled him backwards over the machines.\n\nAll hell broke loose around Germaine as the Iron Lords suddenly opened fire from their positions in the surrounding hills. The townspeople scattered as the fallen Warlords rose in scintillating pillars of Light, the weapons in their hands roaring to life and spitting tracers.\n\n**\n\nThe Ghost watched from high above the chaos. Over the ages, it had gotten very good at hiding. It had gotten very good at all the peculiar things its chosen had asked it to learn.\n\nDown below, gunfire and explosions of Light tore through the collection of huts and shacks. The townspeople fled for their lives in the midst of fire and otherworldly flame as the Iron Lords finally abandoned their sniper positions in the hills to close in on the Warlords at the town center.\n\nThrough it all, the Ghost saw one of the men emerge out of the discharge of an errant explosive device, cradling the body of a child. He moved to relative safety behind one of the shacks and knelt down, holding an ear to the child's face. She was trying to speak.\n\nOne of the armored riders in the town square raised a heavy machine gun in one hand and raked the length of Eaton with golden tracers. The Ghost lost visibility on the townspeople as the hail of machinegun fire filled its vantage point with a rolling cloud of dirt and dust.\n\nThe annihilating, sense-shattering explosions came soon after, and the Ghost increased its elevation.\n\nIt waited until long after the battle had died out, and the surviving Risen had all left, before lowering itself back to earth. It wasn't even sure which side had won. It didn't matter.\n\nThe day had turned to dusk.","name":"Home, pt.

Almost nothing was where he remembered it. Eaton was gone. Blasted and paved. Mild climate was the only reason the shacks and huts that made up most of the town remained standing.\n\nBut the storm of Light versus Light had left scorched earth and shadows behind. And the bones of the dead. It was a blood red dusk. Ghost hovered above him.\n\nThe man looked down at his hands. He tried to chuckle, but coughed instead.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Ghost asked.\n\nHe stood up, straighter than he had in a long time. Easier to seem like people when you slouch.\n\n\"Germaine?\" Ghost asked.\n\n\"That's not my name.\"\n\n\"You let them call you that.\"\n\nThe man turned to look at his Ghost. \"It's not my name. One 'a the Warlords mentioned seeing a lone Ghost. Did you get sloppy?\"\n\nGhost nodded. \"I'm sorry. I was scouting a new livestock route for you and I got carried away.\"\n\n\"I don't ask for much,\" said the man, shaking his head. \"Shovel. Get me one.\"\n\nGhost scanned the debris and ash to find a charred spade, lifting it with a lasso of Light.\n\nThe man slowly gathered all the bones he could find and began to dig.\n\n\"The child. Yu,\" Ghost continued.\n\n\"Stop talking,\" he replied.\n\n\"What did she tell you? You were speaking to her at the end.\"\n\nHe didn't respond. It would be lifetimes before he told Ghost the answer. But he would remember.\n\n\"You could have helped her.\"\n\nThe shovel hit the dirt harder. \"I told you to shut up.\"\n\n\"You could have saved them all.\"\n\nThe man had nothing to say.\n\nHe must have been making more noise than he thought, because just as he finished digging a grave big enough for the bones, a voice called out. He dropped the shovel, stared across the vacant town square at the smoldering ruin of the Diaz barn.\n\nEaton was dead. No point in keeping his secret any longer.\n\nHe crossed the distance at a speed and ease that would have shocked his neighbors and rounded a corner to find Judson, on the ground, leaning against the barn door. There was a cannon in Judson's hand, and his eyes opened wide when he recognized the man and his Ghost.\n\nJudson lifted the gun with a shaking fist. His other hand clutched a dark stain on his side.\n\n\"He's lost a lot of blood,\" Ghost said, its Light spilling across the scene.\n\n\"You were one 'a them all along,\" Judson sneered.\n\nThe man chuckled. \"All my lives, brother.\"\n\n\"You got us killed, you son of a\u2014\"\n\nThe man kicked the firearm out of Judson's hand with no urgency at all. He knelt down to point a finger. \"No, no, that one's on you. Those Warlords caught you. What else were they gonna do? I wanted to stop you from leaving, but I didn't think I had the right.\"\n\nJudson reached out to grab his throat. The man caught his hand in a vice-grip instead, a crushing handshake. Judson frowned and struggled, but he was exhausted. Dying. And the man had strength that belied his frame.\n\nThe man lifted his other hand, smoldering from a Solar glow, and held it against Judson's wound. His former friend managed a high-pitched wail, but couldn't break the man's grip, though he tried and tried.\n\nThe man nodded at Judson, addressing his Ghost. \"Do you see how he never gives up? Because he knows this one life is all he has? No fear.\"\n\n\"Those Risen out there?\" The man finished cauterizing the wound and used his suddenly-cool hand to wave indiscriminately into the darkening night. \"They'd be long dead if they were him. All they know is war. This man survives.\"\n\nJudson made a gurgling sound. He had stopped struggling, but the man kept a grip on his hand.\n\n\"You wanted me to save him? Even if this works, he could never show me how to live. Not like he lives. And that's on you.\"\n\nGhost watched, but made minute adjustments to his orbiting armor and sent Light-based scans cascading across the ruins of town. If there were lingering Warlords or Iron Lords nearby, they would have to run.\n\nThe man stood up. Judson was dead.\n\n\"Maybe you should have told him you were bringing livestock in from a hundred leagues away and releasing them for him to catch,\" Ghost said.\n\n\"I mean\u2014did you see how happy he was? How they all were? They got to eat,\" the man replied. \"Give someone something to chase and you give them purpose.\"\n\n\"You're pathetic. This is what you aspire to be? A perennial liar who plays house with refugees? These people are dead because of us!\"\n\n\"I lived here as one of them.\"\n\n\"You could be so much more. Let me show you how powerful your Light can become.\"\n\nThe man walked past his Ghost and brought Judson's corpse to the center of town. As he began digging again, he noticed the bloated, spherical husk that dominated the sky. It had been out of his life for a while, but it seemed a lot closer to earth tonight.\n\nHe raised a hand to salute it with a single finger, as Ghost looked on.\n\n\"How you livin'?\" he said, and gave a smile to the heavens that ended at his eyes.","name":"Home, pt.

I live a hard life, sister.\" \u2014A Dark Age drifter\n\n\nWu Ming's bar wasn't always bustling, but it was this afternoon. Wu served anyone who could pay, but his clientele were often Risen. Not because he provided a menu particularly suited to them, but because he had built his bar at the foot of a mountain called Felwinter Peak.\n\nFelwinter was a former Warlord\u2014the only one, it was said, to hold an entire mountain all by himself. He now rode with the Iron Lords, and Felwinter Peak was staunchly the territory of the Iron Wolves. They had never given Wu permission to build the bar.\n\nHe had never asked.\n\nAlmost to a person, the patrons tonight were without Ghosts. High winds and inhospitable cold meant those without Ghosts rarely visited. But tonight, word had reached the general population that Warlords were back in the region. No shots had been fired. Not yet. But it was enough to get every poor, Lightless wretch from miles around into Wu's bar, where chances were an Iron Lord or Lady might be having a drink. Wu Ming didn't mind.\n\nThe door swung open again, and a trio of armored figures marched in from the cold. \"Welcome to the End of the World,\" greeted the serving frame. The Warlords shouldered past the 55-30 and headed straight for Wu Ming at the counter.\n\n\"What can I get you?\" Wu asked, giving a smile that ended at his eyes.\n\nThe leading Warlord, a hulking man with shoulder guards larger than his brain, grunted, \"Food. Everything you have.\" \n\nWu raised an eyebrow. \"Sure. That'll be... well, a lotta Glimmer.\"\n\n\"You don't understand,\" the giant man said, grabbing Wu by the lapels of his stormcoat. \"Give us everything you have in the back, or we'll gut you and eat you alive.\"\n\n\"Hey Citan,\" a woman's voice said. \"Pick on someone your own size.\"\n\nAll eyes turned to a helmeted figure standing a few feet behind Citan. She only came up to the giant man's sternum.\n\n\"Lady Efrideet,\" Citan muttered.\n\nWu Ming's gaze went from the Iron Lady to the three Warlords positioned around the bar amongst his Lightless patrons. He cursed under his breath and braced to duck.","name":"Loose Ends, pt.

Felwinter's lost his mind siding with you lot.\"\n\nUnderneath the helm, Citan's eyes flickered from the Iron Lady to his Warlord ally positioned behind her. The flanking Warlord raised a massive hand cannon and thundered a bullet\u2014\n\nDirectly into Citan's chest as Efrideet dropped to a knee. She swung her cannon to her right side with her left fist and let loose with a roaring double-tap behind her, shattering the rear Warlord's head. Wu Ming saw that she hadn't so much as looked.\n\nThe third Warlord's submachine weapon fired a spray of bullets that hammered the floor as Efrideet rolled. Wu cursed inwardly as wood splinters went flying all over the room. People screamed.\n\nBut it was already over. The third Warlord crumpled. Efrideet's solar knife had divided his head.\n\n\"Hold!\" the Lady barked, firing her cannon into the ceiling as three Ghosts materialized above their charges. Bits of wood fell on her shoulder. Wu Ming cursed audibly this time.\n\n\"You know who I am,\" she shouted at the room. \"At this distance, I could shoot all of you out of the air swifter than you could ever bring your Risen back.\"\n\nThe Traveler's children froze, their shells spinning aggressively in the air like metallic bees.\n\n\"You're free to go,\" she told them. \"But your Risen stay with me. Follow the Iron Decree and you'll get them back. In time.\" The Ghosts looked at one another.\n\n\"Tell the Warlords,\" she sneered. \"Felwinter Peak belongs to the Wolves.\"\n\nThe Ghosts left the way their owners came. The bar patrons began murmuring.\n\nEfrideet's Ghost, always a quick thinker, started playing music: Lady Skorri singing an old hymn.\n\nThe patrons backed away from the three Warlord bodies, but began chattering amongst themselves. The din of conversation gradually filled the room and built to a dull roar. The music helped.\n\n\"Is this why you asked me here?\" Efrideet said, holstering her weapon. \"You said you had some business that paid.\"\n\n\"I did. You just finished it,\" he responded, reaching out with a fistful of Glimmer. The Iron Lady stared down at it, gawking beneath her helmet.\n\n\"Who the hell pays you?\"\n\n\"I have means,\" Wu Ming said, chuckling. \"Stick with me, sister. I'll make you rich. I promise.\"\n\nShe eagerly took the sapphire cubes out of his hand. Glimmer represented pure material potential.\n\n\"You didn't bring Felwinter,\" Wu said.\n\nShe eyed him. \"I told you he never comes down from the Peak unless it's official Iron Lord business. What do you need from him?\"\n\n\"Hey, what're you doing later?\" Wu asked suddenly.\n\n\"Hunting Fallen. They're becoming a problem at Boyle Pass. We'll be at it 'til dusk,\" Efrideet said, lifting the helmet just above her mouth to grab a drink from behind the counter and swallow an entire mug of the malt Wu served. She belched and asked, \"Care to join us?\" Her smile just beneath the helm was all teeth.\n\nWu chuckled. \"Nah, a mere mortal at a Risen fight? I'd just get in the way.\" He thought for a second. \"Would you like to dance before you go?\"\n\n\"Nah,\" she said, imitating his tone. The helm came down.\n\nHe cocked his head over the music, then leaned in to ask, \"Wait, what did you think I said?\"\n\n\"Would you like to dance before you go?\" she repeated.\n\n\"I would love to,\" he said, stepping forward, arms wide.\n\nShe side-stepped him and kicked his leg out from under him. He went tumbling to the ground, and someone spilled their drink on him.\n\n\"I had to try,\" he called from the floor, watching her go. The plume of her helmet rose above the crowd, and was already halfway out the door. \"Take the bodies!\" he yelled, still on the ground.\n\n**\n\nIt took him three hours to climb the Peak that night. He was shivering in his long coat, and if not for his Ghost, he would have succumbed to the cold long ago. Ghost was hidden, of course.\n\nThe massive castle doors were already open when he arrived at the top. An Exo, eyes glowing in its sleek black skull, stood just beyond them. It released whatever weapon it was reaching for inside its greatcoat when Wu Ming approached with his hands held high.\n\n\"I come in peace, brother.\"","name":"Loose Ends, pt.

Final-deaths. It's gotten real taboo recently. You Iron Lords are changin' things.\"\n\n\"Who are you?

His only friend in the world materialized out of the air.\n\n\"Is that supposed to impress me?\" Felwinter asked without a shred of irony. \"How else would you have survived the climb?\"\n\nWu coughed.

Will you kill for real?\"\n\n\"As a Warlord, I did many things I'm not proud of. Under the Iron Lords, I adhere to strict rules of engagement,\" Felwinter said.

But I believe in revenge with all my heart. And I have a request, knowing that you do what you do.\"\n\nFelwinter tapped his chin. \"What are you asking me?\"\n\nWu Ming told him a story about a long-forgotten town far away called Eaton, early in the age of Iron Lords. A Lord called Dryden had brought food for the town's starving people, but in return, asked to use them as bait to bring a local Warlord into position for an ambush. This, Wu had learned, went against the code set out by Lord Radegast, the founder of the order. Dryden had broken the rule of involving Lightless individuals in Iron Lord business, because it was those people the Lords had unified to protect. The town had agreed, of course. What choice did it have? But the ambush had gone horribly wrong. The Warlord target had brought a whole fireteam to the fight. Eaton's erasure was utter and complete. Though Wu later learned that Dryden won the battle, he lost every Lord under his command, Ghosts and all, and he committed the additional sin of inflicting final deaths on the Warlords he defeated, in an act of bloodlust and rage. In the intervening years, Wu had learned that Dryden kept this under wraps, and that he and his Ghost were now among the most decorated of Lords, next to the likes of rising champions like Lord Saladin and Lady Efrideet themselves.\n\nFelwinter sat frozen in his chair. It was difficult to tell if he had registered any of what Wu Ming had said.\n\n\"How do I know you're not lying?\" the hollow voice asked finally.\n\n\"I have live recordings,\" Wu replied. His Ghost transmitted a data stream to Felwinter's Ghost, who nodded.\n\n\"Eaton. Who were those people to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Just ghosts.\"\n\n\"You want revenge for people you care nothing about?\"\n\n\"Is the Darkhorse of Iron for hire?\"\n\nFelwinter stood, and politely motioned for Wu Ming to take his leave.\n\nWu sighed, shrugged, and left the chamber. He had a long climb ahead of him.\n\nThe Exo parted his coat and drew a long, bronze shotgun from his side.\n\n\"What do you think?\" his Ghost asked.\n\n\"Call Lord Dryden.

Autopsy team reports a spherical body, radius one point one meters, surfaced in hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced \"throats\" converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body consists of an undifferentiated tissue of primitive cells. A basic spasm reflex forces air down the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\nLavinia reads this again, horrified and fascinated. Something on the far side of the gate is learning to assemble atoms, molecules, even haphazard life... something from a world of darkness and dust, probing its way into our structured existence, trying to cobble together a message, an emissary, a body...\n\nThe Nine are on the far side of this gate. She's sure of it. She's found them.\n\nBut to meet the Nine directly... would that be madness? Would there be any return?

It is the hardest thing in the universe for the dust to make a loop at all, because, like a gust of wind or a river, it was only meant to move one way. For a mind to function, the end of one thought must alter the beginning of the next: so, like rivers, like wind, the Nine could not have minds until they could make loops.\n\nLavinia Garcia Umr Tawil comprehends the Nine.\n\nThey were already ancient when the first human beings named themselves. Their flesh was older than stars: the dark dust wind that blows through the galaxy, pinched by the gravity of Sol and its planets, drawn into their cores and exhaled again.\n\nThese were the Nine.\n\nIn time loops did form. Great arcs of outbound dust collapsed back to their sources to create circuits of shadow. The thickening and thinning of these circuits were the first thoughts of the Nine. They dwelt in massive indifference, unborn primordial gods. There was no force among them except gravity; no structure except the distribution of mass. Their hearts were in the cores of worlds, but their farthest streams faded out into the turn of the galaxy.\n\nThey were the fountains of Achlys, the night before chaos.\n\nBut life arose on the worlds at the heart of the Nine, tiny complicated motions of ecosystems and metabolisms and computations. That life left mass-shadows in the wind of the Nine, plucking at them like harp strings. From these trembles of structure the Nine learned to seed enormous resonating waves, thoughts vaster than worlds.\n\nSo the Nine awoke. And in time they understood that they were as fragile as they were mighty; for if the life that seeded their thoughts ever passed away, they too would vanish.\n\nThey had no eyes to catch light. They had no ears to hear. And yet they turned their wills upon the alien world of Matter, and strove to learn, for they knew they had to protect their hearts, or die.\n\nWith a horror of revelation so absolute that it would drive her mad if she still had sanity to lose, Lavinia understands where the Nine have always been. They are within everyone, every system, every living and moving thing. Trillions and pentillions of slim dark matter tentacles plunged through all our bodies, drinking up the complexity of our lives and thoughts.\n\nWe are all pinched silhouettes impaled on the twitchings of infinitely long spiderlegs.","name":"The Nine","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/165c2e753b9ef64b2b9046ce8211840c.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":3891297049,"index":942,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"3891297048":{"displayProperties":{"description":"Came now the Traveler, and with it a strange hope\u2014for the Traveler's Light had the power to cause without causation! If the Nine had the Light, they could seed their own minds, free themselves from the dependence on matter-life! They could gain forces beyond Gravity to structure themselves, and so become more than wraiths of dark dust. They could enter the mad alien superworld of our chemical reality.\n\nSo they turned to this new hope... and were divided.\n\n\"Come to me,\" a voice calls to Lavinia, although there is nowhere to go, nothing to be, not even emptiness but the absence of anything to be empty or full. Lavinia perceives, without emotion, that she now exists as a structure of dark dust, a sandstorm blowing against itself.\n\n\"Come,\" the voice calls. \"I am Nasya. You are not safe. Come with me.\"\n\nNot safe?\n\nNo. Of course she is not safe. Because there are factions among the Nine: one faction sent X\u00fbr and Orin to study Guardians and the Light, to seek the secret of effect-without-cause and to protect the source of that secret, the last source, now that the Ahamkara are gone. Those five played at alchemy with the Cocytus gates, turning dark dust into energy and then into matter, but they could not unlock the secrets of our mad existence. They needed ambassadors. Go-betweens.\n\nThe other faction walks a different path. A path of folds and needles slipped through spacetime itself, existential syringes yielding new spaces, to be remade as the Nine desire. They have tried to gather enough dark dust in one place to form a black hole, and found it difficult: when the dark mass collapses in gravity's fist, the dust passes through itself and scatters.\n\nBut difficult is not impossible. And there is far, far more dark matter in the universe than bright. They will find a way to make new worlds of it. They will end their dependence on life, and on the Light of Guardians, which the falling veil will soon snuff out forever...\n\nIn passing, Lavinia sees the entire history of the Queen's interactions with the Nine: more than anyone suspected, and more vital. She sees how one of the Nine blinded Guardians to Ghaul's approach, risking everything (for Ghaul would have destroyed the sun, and the Nine with it) to learn how to steal the Light.

Fallen armed forces continue to fall back from active fronts across Terra. Factions of House Dusk remain active in the European Dead Zone. Throughout the rest of the globe, refugee attack incidents have dropped by more than 70% since the conclusion of the Red War\u2014largely attributable to depressed Fallen and human populations rather than any significant change in interspecies relations.\n\n2. In absence of any united leadership, House Dusk continues to splinter and radicalize.\n\nThe recent trending emergence of so-called \"crime syndicates\" (cf. report #004-FALLEN-SIV) is emblematic of the continuing destructuralization of Fallen society. Likely an artifact of multi-generational colonization of human strongholds, this agent believes that because these syndicates have no relation to indigenous Fallen culture, young Fallen are appropriating and imitating human mythology in absence of a strong cultural heritage of their own.\n\nMuch like the dissolution of the Kell\/Archon theology, this is positive news for those interested in the complete extirpation of invasive Fallen from the system.\n\n3. That being said, we should continue to monitor reunification efforts. Several personalities have emerged as potential leaders. First, the would-be integrationists:\n\nVIP #1121, well-known to Guardians of the inner system as Variks, or Variks the Loyal. Directly responsible for the release of the murderer Uldren Sov from the Prison of Elders, #1121 subsequently fled Awoken holdings in the Reef and now styles himself the Kell of Kells, still representing House Judgement. The Praxic Order has petitioned the Vanguard for permission to detain #1121. The Awoken monarchy, acting through the Queen's Wrath, has claimed jurisdiction over #1121 and further stated that any prosecution in absence of their involvement will be considered an act of war. The Vanguard has not yet made a statement about their position on the issue.\n\nVIP #3987, another former confederate of the Awoken, is a lesser-known personality known as Mithrax. Scattered field reports suggest that like #1121, #3987 styles himself a Kell of the so-called \"House Light,\" an otherwise unknown House apparently founded by #3987 himself. We have secondhand accounts that Mithrax has engaged in allied operations with Guardians in the field, though we have not as yet been able to corroborate these accounts with any degree of veracity. This agent is inclined to treat these reports with a healthy degree of skepticism until otherwise confirmed, as they may be propaganda from Fallen sympathizers in the Old Russian and Red War Guardian cohorts. We have requested intelligence records from the Awoken which may further clarify the matter.\n\nIn addition, whatever the findings of said intelligence records may be, it should be stressed that one or two sympathetic outliers cannot be relied upon to erase the wrongs of past centuries, nor should their good-faith efforts to correct the sins of their forebears be taken as sufficient symbolic reparation.\n\nSecond, the would-be separatists:\n\nVIP #4503, a recent personality known as Fikrul, or the Fanatic. A close confederate of the murderer Uldren Sov, #4503 has the apparent ability to raise himself from the dead in a manner not dissimilar to Ghost-aided resurrection. Though his reign on the Tangled Shore was limited, he possesses sufficient skill, hatred, and motive to warrant on-going surveillance. Given #4503's propensity for resurrection, the inherent risk of #4503 reclaiming the body of the murderer Uldren Sov from his final resting place in the Dreaming City goes without saying. The Vanguard continues to deploy fireteams to suppress #4503; our agents have reached out to the Cryptarchy and the Gensym Scribes to request guidance as to his permanent destruction.\n\nVIP #2029, a once-known personality known as Eramis, or Eramis, the Shipstealer. A House Devils Baroness incarcerated during the Wolf Wars, #2029 successfully fled the Prison of Elders during the mass escape orchestrated by #1121. #2029 is a classical Fallen pirate of the old ways: vicious, uncompromising, and possessing cunning of the highest degree. Field reports indicate that she is rallying violent dissidents to reconstruct House Devils from the ground up. This agent believes her to be the most viable candidate for universal Fallen reunification, and would urge the Vanguard and other interested leadership to aggressively prioritize her destruction.\n\nWe have come too far to pull our punches now.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Outliers","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507760,"index":953,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507763":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 1021-CITY-VAN\nAGENT(S): IKO-006\nSUBJ: Instability of leadership\n\n1. Following the events of the Red War and the recent loss of the Hunter Vanguard, current acting Vanguard leadership has struggled to define its function and role within what is an otherwise largely egalitarian and self-governing body of active Guardians. Much like the current popular perception of the Awoken queen, we have failed to adequately respond to questions about our integrity, competence, and unity as we have grieved the loss of the Hunter Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard was never intended as a governing body of authoritarians, nor does it function as such, but in times of turmoil and uncertainty, people rightly look to figures of strength for guidance and support. Neither the Titan Vanguard nor I ever intended to become politicians. We are warriors, first and foremost, and we no longer feel that we are able to serve as such.\n\nIn the spirit of honest self-reflection in the face of justified skepticism, we have begun to discuss the possibility of stepping down to invite new leadership into our place, as well as the general merits of disbanding the Vanguard entirely\u2014largely because we believe that this crisis of identity will plague anyone who steps into this role. We recognize that this is ill-timed, and we will endeavor to involve the Consensus, the Guardians themselves, and all other interested parties in the discussion as appropriate. I specifically invite the Hidden to closely monitor the situation without my involvement. Should you agree that we are doing more harm than good, please do not hesitate to take whatever actions you agree are necessary.\n\n2. Regarding the open Hunter Vanguard position and the terms of Cayde's Dare: The situation is unprecedented. Were we to trace the chain of culpability back to its first link, I believe we would be obligated to elect a Hive god to our council.\n\nOur current inclination is to caucus with the Hunters to debate the benefits of opening the position to any interested and well-qualified Hunter. Such a debate is, of course, contingent upon the continued existence of the Vanguard itself. We will make an effort to convene the Hunters as soon as possible, but this group should be well aware that most credible candidates have fled the Tower in anticipation of such a debate.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Instability","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507763,"index":954,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507762":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 002-A899OF-COC\nAGENT(S): TRU-135\nSUBJ: Intercepted transmission\n\nSENSITIVE!! \u2013 CONTENTS BELOW SNIFFED FROM ENCRYPTED REEF DATACOMS \u2013 SENSITIVE!!\n\n1. We are maintaining our containment posture at Cocytus. I assess no immediate danger to the system, and we have enough firepower to destroy the station and its mechanisms remotely if the on-site warheads fail. The station remains in the stable heliocentric orbit where it was parked after the destruction of Ceres.\n\n2. I do not ask confirmation of these theories, and in fact I beg you not to address them. But I have reviewed the site records, and the fate of the Sophia's crew after they were herded to Cocytus stinks of Hive madness. The Cocytus apertures must\u2014at the time\u2014have opened into a Hive manifold associated with Crota. Whatever their original purpose, when Crota established his presence in the system, they became conduits into hell... and the Sophia crew's ugly end proved it. Whoever drove the Sophia to its doom then installed the Cocytus Instruments around the original Golden Age facility to study Crota's manifold.\n\n3. Crota is dead. His hold on these gates has passed. Now something else is trying to pass through into our world... but it is so alien, and its sendings so bafflingly malformed, that I fear this can only end in madness.\n\n4. The first \"visitors\" through the third gate, at event time 00:00:00, were simple hydrogen atoms. Over the course of 72 hours, the emissions developed from diatomic hydrogen to nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and simple organic molecules. At the 80-hour mark, we received our first macroscopic visitor, a pellet of thick black hydrocarbon tar. Until 82:34:15 the gate vomited tar containing increasingly complex monomers and polymers.\n\n5. The visitors then began to assume geometric form. A hail of cubes and hexagons, each built from molecular crystal of the same form as the whole. A series of fractal shapes that shattered under internal flaws. Several capsules or membranes of increasingly complex structure, containing water or oil. These may have been cellular precursors.\n\n6. At 524:03:11 a living organism appeared. Death was immediate. Remote dissection describes a spherical body, radius approximately one meter, surfaced in thick hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced \"throats\" converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body exhibited undifferentiated tissue of primitive plantlike cells, capable of spasming to pump air or fluid in and out of the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, or internal structure to dispose of waste, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred almost instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n7. At 690:29:54 the gate emitted a tubular organism. For ninety seconds the organism moved across the gate chamber by contracting and expanding, then expired. Remote dissection describes a two-meter-long body with a spinal cavity full of energy-rich carbohydrate fluid. The organism's contractions forced this fluid through a capillary network, where simple cells catabolized the carbohydrates into energy to power further contractions. The buildup of heat and waste quickly denatured the enzymes required for metabolism, and the organism died. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n8. The gate has remained inactive since, barring short emissions of molecules which may be experimental proteins. Remote drones have registered similar ambient molecules within the Hellmouth on Luna, though we have been unable to identify their source. We will maintain the quarantine until otherwise instructed.\n\nThe overwhelming impression I have is one of learning, of increasing sophistication in the synthesis and arrangement of matter. The atoms in these structures were isotopically pure and impossible to date, but I have the uncomfortable sense that even they were freshly made.\n\n9. Probes and instruments dispatched through the third gate do not return. Annihilation is apparently immediate, and so total that it seems to result from a fundamental failure of the ability to exist rather than any weapon or countermeasure.

Everybody's favorite conspiracy theorist is publishing again. Here's an excerpt from his latest paper\u2014incomplete, I'm afraid, but you try for hi-def OCR at 500m during a rainstorm and tell me how you do.\n\n2. ...remain major unanswered questions about the failure of the City's information, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) network to detect the approaching Red Legion fleet.\n\nIt is by now well accepted that the Red Legion's sophistication in military affairs vastly exceeded our own. Although Ghaul's campaign made no real provision for continued resistance after the Traveler was contained and the Almighty moved into firing position, his opening gambit achieved a level of strategic surprise that would be the envy of any ancient general. Psion electronic warfare units compromised the City's sensor perimeters and suppressed our satellite early warning systems (so thoroughly that they even maintained their failsafe signals until the last possible moment). An extraordinary deception program in the Prison of Elders, combined with relativistic projectile strikes against key sensors, blinded the Reef to a simultaneous attack.\n\nBut how did the Red Legion escape the notice of the entire scattered Dead Orbit fleet? It would be politically unwise to suggest that the Arachs withheld information so their precious ships would be spared a losing battle... and indeed, the integrity of that same fleet proved invaluable in the counterattack and the city's reconstruction. It would be even more politically incendiary to suggest that the Future War Cult viewed the City's brief occupation as politically useful (or, more charitably, as a necessary step towards some desirable future timeline).\n\nBut it is impossible not to ask: how did the same Guardians who foresaw Oryx in prophecy (and in captured enemy material) fail to anticipate and take measures against the Red Legion attack? Is there something intrinsically more secular, and thus unforeseeable, about the Cabal? Do they practice superior information security to the Hive\u2014unlikely, given the interception of a Cabal distress signal in the wake of the Taken War?\n\nDid some agency, henceforth unknown, act to conceal Ghaul's approach from our protectors? One that shared with Ghaul some central motive\u2014whether the destruction of the Guardians, the capture of the Traveler, or the apprehension by force of the abilities we call the Light?\n\nIf such an agency exists, capable of such totality and subtlety in its action, how has it concealed itself from us?\n\n3. If I didn't know better, I'd say we had a leak. Hassan's a real ringer. Hope he gets rezzed as one of us when he dies.\n\n4.

As you all know, an unknown sender delivered six messages to VIP #2014. These missives were sent via Glimmer, using a simple encryption scheme that even a 55-30 unit Frame could have easily cracked. #2014's Ghost took immediate notice of these messages and quietly forwarded them on to IKO-006, who then distributed them back to us. Cf. reports #167-173-VESTA-DC for full transcripts.\n\n2. In these messages, the sender briefly purports to be none other than one ERI-223, providing fanciful details regarding her origins as a human woman who grew up in an apparent settlement of Old Russia known as St. Petersburg. None of this account sat well with anyone who actually knows ERI-223\u2014not simply because none of her close confederates had any firsthand knowledge or belief that she knew of her pre-Guardian origins, but also because she is still active in the field and has personally denied sending these messages. That being said, in accordance with our rigor for skeptical inquiry, this agent was dispatched in pursuit of hard evidence to the contrary.\n\n3. I submit to you now photographic and video evidence recovered from civilian family albums, historical archives, and extant Ghost recordings originally captured in the Last City. Behold, ERI-223: a child of the Last City, born to civilian parents in a mortal-Guardian integrated neighborhood. Behold, too, tiny VIP #1786\u2014though he is almost more unbelievable than ERI-223, if you look at his smile.\n\nOf the photos, original digital files are unavailable, but radiocarbon dating clearly identifies the earliest prints as more than three hundred years old. This is consistent with the timestamps of footage provided by volunteer Ghosts who were present during the same period. As to whether the child we believe to be ERI-223 is indeed ERI-223, please see the second compressed folder attached to this report for full double-blind forensics.\n\n4. In regards to the other personality presented in the six messages: Having consulted with AI-COM\/RSPN and AI-COM\/XBLK, both have attested that they have no record of any so-called craftmind designated Medusa. This does not discount the possibility that such a craftmind may have existed, but in light of the fact that someone was impersonating our former colleague, it follows that someone may have credibly invented a craftmind as well. We will continue to scour our records for any evidence to the contrary.\n\n5. Like many of those reading, this agent has a strong recommendation about the identity of the sender, but it is beyond the scope of this report. Cf. reports #024-VESTA-DC, 025-VESTA-DC, #026-VESTA-DC, #086-VESTA-DC, #001-034-HIVE-SAV, and #001-005-HIVE-DUL.\n\n6. Given the importance of #2014's contributions to our defense efforts as well as the recent downfall of the Awoken prince, this agent is deeply troubled by the idea that a malicious entity might seek to sway or confuse #2014 through the context of trusted allies. #2014's Ghost made brief mention of some kind of waking hallucination in one of its messages. Have we reached out to corroborate that report or provide additional counsel?\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Forgeries","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507764,"index":957,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507767":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 059-CABAL-LEV\nAGENT(S): TRU-135\nSUBJ: Sitrep\n\n1. Live-fire training exercises continue at the active incursion site on the Leviathan. No further RAID class operations have been documented since the unauthorized intervention against VIP #4044 at the explicit invitation of VIP #3801. This agent still believes that the Vanguard should institute stronger measures to prevent rogue teams from carelessly rushing to the aid of enemy VIPs \u2013 particularly given #3801's documented history of solicitous behavior and the tendency of our warriors to rush slack-jawed toward free gifts. #4044 could have been a useful catspaw in the destruction of #3801. We should not have intervened.\n\n2. Related to the above, #3801's aggressive propaganda campaign appears to have been successful. Despite #3801's recent inactivity, sentiment polls captured in the Tower at regular intervals over the last several months indicate that he has successfully swayed a significant percentage of the Red War cohort to believe that he may be a potential ally. Given our history with the Cabal as well as the events of the Red War itself, this is shocking and perhaps attributable to a case of mass traumatic bonding.\n\nIt is my strong recommendation that the Vanguard pursue a reeducation curriculum before #3801 invites any Guardians of the City to defect to his service, a possibility which we have documented in multiple previous reports.\n\n3. Nessus continues to remain stable, likely due to Vex machinoforming.\n\n4. The Awoken armada continues regular shows of force. The Leviathan remains non-hostile.\n\n5. Our agents continue to closely monitor inbound and outbound traffic to and from the Leviathan. As yet, we have not been able to observe any non-Guardian transport, providing additional evidence for the fact that the ship is either a self-contained ecosystem which has no paracausal exits or that it possesses some kind of internal stargate network by which occupants may invisibly enter and exit. As the Cabal have no documented history of such stargates, we are inclined to believe the former.\n\n6. In summary, there is no real news. However, this agent is inclined to regard this conspicuous passivity with suspicion rather than relief, and would urge Vanguard leadership to consider exploratory excursions in coming months.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Passivity","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507767,"index":958,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507766":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 12059-INCID-LUN\nAGENT(S): FEN-092\nSUBJ: Affidavit regarding Incident #12059\n\n1. Last week, I was deployed by IKO-006 for routine surveillance of the quarantined zone outside the Hellmouth. Hive populations remain low and grow ever lower thanks to the efforts of a small contingent of veteran Guardians who have made their homes on Luna.\n\n2. Around 1900 hours yesterday afternoon, I began to experience a crushing headache and excused myself from patrol to recuperate. Though I originally intended to lay down for a nap, I fell asleep instead, and experienced multiple vivid dreams over the next 11.5 hours. In all of these dreams, I was trying to catch up with agent ERI-223 in a crowd. She was always out of reach, whether by 200 m or 20 m. I had the sense that I needed to speak to her.\n\n3. When I woke, I found that my headache had not improved. I prepared my armor and exited my bivouac to find a single stationary Thrall crouched nearby. It stood as I approached, but made no motion to attack me. I fired one shot, killing it immediately. Upon stepping forward to examine its corpse, I saw a solid black fragment of an unknown material embedded in its chest cavity. The fragment resembled a flake or a shard of some larger object, not dissimilar to a high-gain photovoltaic panel.\n\n4. I requested that my Ghost perform a standard material analysis of the fragment but neither one of us could confidently identify its qualities or provenance; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #1.\n\n5. I requested that my Ghost attempt to contain and transmat the fragment for quarantine on my jumpship. He was unable to establish a Light link with the object, describing the fragment as \"slippery\" and \"tiring\" to try to catch hold of.\n\n6. I used the barrel of my sniper rifle to touch and then work the fragment out of the Thrall's corpse. Using my rifle, I turned the fragment over and examined it from multiple angles. I requested that my Ghost run another deep scan of the object; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #2.\n\n7. We concluded that the material seemed to be inert and that it did not seem to be part of any complex device or mechanism.\n\n8. At this point, I broke protocol and did not request additional backup. Instead, I picked up the fragment by hand and immediately experienced a vivid hallucination: I stood over VIP #0704's  shoulder as she dressed a seven-inch gash on agent ERI-223's thigh. Both #0704 and ERI-223 were dressed for combat. Hundreds of fragments of the unknown material hung in the air around us, apparent shrapnel from the wreckage of a nearby ship of unrecognizable make and model. ERI-223 looked directly toward me and said, \"\u041f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f.\"\n\n9. The duration of the hallucination was approximately seven seconds. At its conclusion, my headache disappeared. My Ghost and I held our position for the next thirty minutes, then collected the body of the Thrall and the fragment for transportation. I delivered myself and my cargo to quarantine and experienced no further mental disturbances while detained.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Fragment","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507766,"index":959,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507769":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 045-VIP-1315\nAGENT(S): IKO-006\nSUBJ: Leased space in the Annex\n\n1. After several months of negotiation, the Vanguard has agreed to allow VIP #1315 to formally lease an unused warehouse space in the Annex of the new Tower. To be clear, this was the Vanguard's proposal, not his. Despite the many skeptics who have good questions about the social risk inherent in providing #1315 with a more legitimate space, we feel that any disruption of morale or Tower culture will be short-term and minimal. Likewise, we feel that he does not present any present danger to Tower or City inhabitants.

It is my belief that his presence will do more good than ill, and that the Tower has long stunted its own growth through narrow-minded fear and reactive exile of dissidents. We should endeavor to remain sharp skeptics of philosophies which differ from our own, but we should always be willing to hear and consider these philosophies.\n\nFurther: any concerned members of the Praxic Order should recall that the Vanguard holds jurisdiction over their actions, and that the exile of dissident philosophers is very different from the exile of rogue operators.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS","name":"Lease","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/dbc983c265b4ccc2a7e527b35b0ab110.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1564507769,"index":960,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1564507768":{"displayProperties":{"description":"ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 053-VIP-1315\nAGENT(S): AUN-326\nSUBJ: Psych eval\n\n1. THIS DATA OBTAINED FROM SURVEILLANCE DEVICES AT 1315-HOME2.\n\n2. In previous reports, I stated that it was my belief that #1315 had invoked some kind of paracausal event enabling the resurrection and return of enemy VIP #2015. This belief was predicated upon reports of creatures resembling the infamous \"Echoes of Oryx\" that Guardian forces engaged and destroyed en masse during the Taken War (cf. Ghost-stream footage here: CATHEDRAL.OF.DUSK.DREADNAUGHT).\n\nThis has proven false. Spectral analysis from multiple Ghosts participating undercover in Prime and Reckoning confirms that the impossible world at the heart of \"the haul\" is located in unknown space. (Cf. REP #001-012-PARAC-NINE.) Further, these Primevals differ in their literal elemental composition: low SNC, high ambient \u039bCDM. #1315 has harnessed his \"banks\" to what appears to be an engine of pure potential. He no longer needs to pilfer the Ascendant Plane of Primevals, the oldest Taken in residence. He can create Primeval-likes from the energy of \"the haul\" and sheer force of will. As to the apparent presence of #2015, it is a falsehood. My handlers in the Praxic Order surmise simply: the shape of Oryx was the scariest Hive he could think of. He's tenacious, but he has a small mind.\n\n3. Highly recommend we assess #1315 for the influence of paracausal forces or entities. Since the conclusion of the joint Vanguard\/Praxic investigation into his operations, the subject has become increasingly erratic. Beyond running his Gambit and Reckoning drills with the Guardian population, he has done nothing but hole up in the Annex. He has always exhibited the signs of stress related to prolonged solitude that are typical of all surviving Risen; this manifests in the subject in prolonged and rambling conversations with either himself or his as-yet-unseen Ghost. However, his musings have become less and less coherent over time. Late into the night, away from the Guardian cohorts, he yells at voices that our surveillance equipment has never picked up. He has spoken to himself about trips across vast, interstellar distances to realms no Guardian has ever described.\n\nAgain, he has not left the Annex in ages. One might say that I am overstepping even Praxic boundaries here, but I would say to them: the subject is free to leave any time.\n\n4. Following the results of my investigation, the subject has ceased regular reports to Lord Shaxx. I'm sure both prefer it that way. #1315 has broken none of the Vanguard's decrees in that time, nor have any further Guardians perished on his watch in Gambit or Reckoning. He is still a facilitator to murder and a thief, but he has done nothing to warrant eviction, as I had hoped. The Vanguard obviously still needs him.\n\n5.

She carries in her knapsack an unopened letter from her brother, her mother's ashes, a selection of seeds and cuttings from her favorite neighborhood trees and plants, and some thirty thousand songs and short videos on a hand-me-down myoelectric augment.\n\nOn the ship's manifest, Nasya Sarwar is one of two dozen classless Scopares, trash collectors and composters and caretakers devoted to endlessly tidying the many surfaces and people within the Yang Liwei that cannot or do not clean themselves. She hopes through hard work and perseverance, she will prove herself worthy of one of the ship's remaining civilian cryopods, or\u2014even better\u2014a promotion to an Auturge position where she believes she'll find the freedom to devote her waking hours entirely to the loving care of the ship's hydroponics facilities.\n\nNasya is quadrilingual. Several of her fellow Scopares are not: born monolinguals who got lucky in international Exodus lotteries, just like she did. When they realize that she can speak to some of them, they do their best to befriend her. They share meals. They show her photos of the loved ones they left behind. They explain the function of the ship's many impossible machines. In turn, she does her best to teach them how to speak to the others. In this way, they are all a little less alone.\n\nShe is twenty-seven years old.\n\n\n2.\n\nOn the day she awakens in the Distributary, she names herself Nasan Ar. She carries in her hands a small silver jar. A dent has crushed its lid; it is impossible to open. She does not know its provenance, but she feels an inexplicable tugging of grief in her chest when she thinks about walking on without it.\n\nShe makes herself a home under the largest tree she can find. In the early days, it is little more than a lean-to and a campfire, but she shares it willingly with whoever passes by. Her guests help her transform the lean-to into a proper cottage with several guest beds. One cottage becomes two, then two is three, until three becomes a village.\n\nNasan loves her guests and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become mother or mayor. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press tight around her. She is shackled to the earth by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. She feels monstrous. Why doesn't she love this? Why doesn't she want to stay?\n\nOne clear night, amid the honey-heavy smell of spring flowers and recent rain, she takes her silver jar and goes out into the dripping dark.\n\n\n3.\n\nShe wanders. She tries on lives like she is trying on city-tailored fashions: for a few weeks, she is a Corsair. Then for a whole summer, she is a field hand. When she tires of that, she balances books for an atom merchant who trades in radioactive materials. Nothing holds her. Seeing her silver jar, one man suggests she may be a treasure hunter. The idea sends her deep into a subterranean cavern where she finds no treasure, but instead bioluminescent worms and a Paladin who calls herself Sjur Eido.\n\n\"If you're looking for a job,\" Sjur says, \"I should introduce you to my boss.\"\n\n\n4.\n\nOn the day Nasan finds her calling, the Diasyrm styles her a translator. It confuses her, because the Speech is the Speech. Variations have developed over time, but none are so distant from each other that two Awoken from around the world cannot speak to each other. \"What do you mean?\" Nasan asks.\n\n\"Well,\" the Diasyrm says. \"I've been watching since you arrived. People look to you when they're fighting, and you try to understand each side before you try to help. When you speak, you do it deftly, without condescension.\" She considers Nasan. \"It seems to me that you lend people grace when you help them explain themselves.\"\n\nA little candle of pride flickers in Nasan's throat. \"That's just mediation,\" she says, glancing away.\n\n\"Don't sell yourself short. Anyone can break up a fight. Few people can so clearly grasp the spirit of a thought, then rephrase it so that deaf ears hear it. Gifts like that can end wars.\" Thinking on that, the Diasyrm sobers. \"We'll have to keep your talent to ourselves, for now. The Sanguine would just as soon cut out your tongue.\"\n\n\n5.\n\nThe Theodicy War is a fact of life until it isn't. The killing stops, but the wounds remain. Nasan helps the Awoken mend. Her friends urge her to speak publicly, to help people on a grander scale, but Nasan believes the most effective change happens in groups of fewer than ten.","name":"Seeds and Cuttings","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/cea968a40ffb450d042a4f56751aec00.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1164559471,"index":962,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1164559468":{"displayProperties":{"description":"6.\n\nShe is standing in a crowd of thousands when Mara Sov tells the Awoken about the dying world they abandoned.

She holds her silver jar to her forehead, focusing on its cool constant weight, and knows that she must leave.\n\n\n7.\n\nShe finds her old friend Sjur. Amid the feverish departure preparations, there is somehow time for an introduction to Mara. Nasan makes a pledge of herself and her skills.

There are so many different truths that ring through Mara's carefully chosen words: chords of nuanced meaning that she feels she might be able to separate out into cleaner notes for frightened minds craving simplicity.\n\nShe does what she can. In quiet hours and fragmented conversations, she becomes an unconventional counselor to the would-be queen.\n\nWhen the first fragile attempts at rebuilding society run afoul of the Long Unquiet Night, then the discovery of the Traveler and the Fallen, and then inevitably turn to riot and desertion, Nasan goes to Mara again to pledge her services. \"Let me go after them,\" she begs, not a day after the proclamation that they all hear in their skulls instead of their ears. \"I don't mean to change their minds or convince them to come back. I just\u2014\"\n\n\"Then what DO you mean to do?\" Sjur asks curiously. Mara watches her with ageless patience, waiting for her to find the words.\n\nNasan purses her lips. \"I want them to understand that you are\u2014that you\u2014that you are good. That you aren't what they think.\" Seeing Sjur bristle, she holds up her hand. To her relief, Mara makes a slight warding gesture as well. \"And if they know that and still wish to live apart from us on Earth, that's fine. That's their choice.\"\n\n\"I don't need them to understand that,\" Mara says softly. There is the faintest husk of grief in her steady voice.\n\n\"No,\" Nasan agrees, relieved that Mara is willing to consider this truth. \"You don't. You have the courage to be disliked, and that is uncommon. But it is just as important, sometimes, to cultivate good will...\" Especially if you have forgotten what it feels like to not know everything, she thinks.\n\nMara looks away. Nasan watches closely and thinks that perhaps she has been heard. Sjur shifts her weight impatiently, tired by all this meaningful silence. It has been a long nineteen hours.\n\n\"If you go,\" Mara says finally, \"you cannot come back.\"\n\nNasan hears the truth in it. She reaches to clasp Mara's hand. \"Of course.\"\n\n\n10.\n\nSo she goes to Earth.

As he speaks, Orin looks around. They are surrounded by a young forest vivacious with birds and clouds of gnats. It is impossible to imagine that a deadly alien might be lurking somewhere nearby. But Gol found her. Gol knows more about the world than she does. She trusts him.\n\nShe scavenges the leaf litter until she finds a fallen tree limb. \"Will this help?\" she asks him, testing its heft. He twists his wings, puzzled. \"...Against the aliens,\" she elaborates.\n\n\"Oh.\" Courteous, he pretends to consider it, then, \"No. Probably not. They have guns.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she says, though she doesn't. She breaks off the smaller branches, using her foot for leverage. Soon, she has a crude mace. It is heavy, slow, and does not break when she tests it against a tree trunk.\n\nShe doesn't know what the aliens look like. She does not know what guns are.  She does trust Gol. But, she can't help thinking, if an alien tried to attack her while she was armed with a stick like this, she would have no trouble crushing its skull.\n\n\n12.\n\nThey reach the settlement. It is smoldering cinder and ruin. Gol frets about \"fission products\" and \"acute radiation,\" so Orin lingers at a distance and studies what remains. A cat moves among the most distant rubble, hunting for mice. A tattered banner stirs in the breeze. She sees nothing more, so she ignores Gol's warning and goes in for a closer look.\n\nShe finds bodies. Adults, mostly. Some children. There are little houses for big animals, but there are no big animals among the dead.\n\n\"How did this happen?\" she asks, overcome by grief for these charred strangers. \"Aliens?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. The Fallen don't often use nuclear weapons. It ruins the land. My guess is that a Warlord raided this place for its livestock and then set off a bomb.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nGol gives a little shrug, bobbing in place. \"Why not? No one was here to stop them.\"\n\nOrin clenches her mace a little tighter. She feels nauseous. \"Can you tell when it happened?\"\n\nHe runs the computations. \"Not precisely. Less than thirty-six hours ago, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I should have walked faster,\" she mutters, and then bends over to be sick.\n\n\"You can't do that here,\" Gol interrupts anxiously. \"Stop, Orin. Stop. You have radiation poisoning. If you're sick here, you'll die here, and then I'll have to resurrect you here, and you'll be sick and die again and again. You have to move. Come. I told you not to walk around here.\"","name":"Risen","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/cea968a40ffb450d042a4f56751aec00.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":1164559469,"index":964,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1164559466":{"displayProperties":{"description":"13.\n\nOrin graduates from wooden mace to stolen Scorch Cannon, from bare flesh to salvaged plate.

She is a graceless fighter with an unflappably grim resolve, so when they sweep in to help her, she does not immediately recognize them as the cavalry; she sees them coming, considers the odds, and then raises her empty Scorch Cannon to wield as a maul. Seventeen to one? She'll try her luck.\n\nThey laugh about it later over weak tea and hardtack.\n\n\n15.\n\nWhen the Guard invites her to join them, they present her with a war hammer.

Their numbers wax and wane over time, but they are forever the watchers-in-the-dark, the living-shield-that-shelters, the ladder-which-humanity-will-climb-toward-rebirth. Inspiring campfire speeches are an endless fact of life, and they buoy her until she begins to recognize the leitmotifs of self-sacrificing heroism.\n\nOrin loves her leaders and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become soldier or symbol. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press around her. She is shackled to the wilds by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. Alone on night watch, she tells Gol that she feels monstrous.

They come and go, but mostly they go.\n\nStill, they reroute their caravan. The land down south is good: arable, temperate, and with too many indigenous parasites for the Fallen to wish it as a customary home. Even if there is no safe city there, it is a better place to guide civilians than the ravaged deserts and plains of the north.\n\nOrin hopes the rumors are true, but it is a selfish hope: If the city is real, and people are safe there, then maybe she can rest.\n\n\n19.\n\n\"City\" is a misnomer; it has been a misnomer since this place's inception. It is a chaotic sprawl of tents and shabby lean-tos. There is not a single permanent structure among them. The streets are nothing more than muddy pathways that smell of waste and smoke. But the people! Neither Orin nor Gol have seen so many people in all their lives.\n\nFilthy children scream with laughter as they play tag around salvaged tanks. A civilian militia stands vigil over cassava farmers.

His Hildian sustained damage during a dog-fight with a Fallen skiff, and now an important pump is leaking. He cannot find the source of the leak, nor does he have the supplies to repair it. The rest of the Awoken are at home, in the Reef.\n\nThe gun is a standard-issue Tigerspite AR; it uses cased telescoped rounds made of a proprietary plasteel-spinmetal blend. There are engineers hard at work on manufacturing techniques that will allow for widespread distribution of the weapon to Risen and civilian populations on Earth.\n\nPeople do avoid him. Earthborn and Risen Awoken almost never speak to him; he is surprised that she bothered. He does hear voices; he does have prophetic dreams. He describes it all in detail and she is shocked by how familiar it sounds. It is like listening to a recording of herself.\n\nAt her final question, he hesitates. He runs a grimy hand through his hair and looks up at the stars. They have been talking a long time. \"If we're going to talk some more,\" he says at last, \"we might as well have a drink.\"\n\n\n23.\n\nNamqi is not particularly tall, nor particularly handsome. Taken in isolation, parts of him are beautiful. His nose. His hands. The lines of his throat. The coruscating light that passes over his skin fascinates her; she watches to see if its patterns match her own. They do not.\n\nMost of all, Orin is struck by his ability to listen with empathy. He is quiet more often than not. Long silences don't frighten him. And when he speaks, he does it deftly, without condescension.\n\n\n24.\n\nIt takes eight weeks to repair the leaking pump. In that time, Orin convinces Namqi to break queenslaw and smuggle her and Gol beyond the Vestian Outpost. She is determined to understand why she revolted against her own people.\n\nThey are scarcely a half-day's burn toward Interamnia before they are intercepted by Galliots painted in the Queen's colors.\n\n\n25.\n\n\"Woof,\" Sjur Eido says when she sees Orin for the first time, \"Mara's gonna hate this.\" She crosses the detainment cell to get a better look at Gol. \"Figured this might happen eventually, but I'd always hoped...\" She pulls at the nape of her neck, then gives a little half-shrug: well, what can you do.\n\nTurning, she looks at Namqi. \"You know you broke the law, right?\"\n\nHe nods.\n\nShe claps him on the shoulder and smiles. \"My man.\"\n\n\n26.\n\nTwo Paladins deliver her to Mara Sov. Gol is not permitted in the court, nor is Namqi.\n\n\"I knew you,\" Orin says before Mara can speak. It is uncourtly etiquette, she supposes, but they are alone and she is too bold to fear offense.\n\n\"What do you remember?\"\n\nOrin gives a slight shake of her head. Moments pass. Mara, too, is comfortable with silence. Behind her mask of composed indifference, her eyes are sharp with curiosity.\n\n\"Why did I leave?\" Orin asks.\n\n\"You wished to be my emissary.\"\n\n\"And you banished me for it?\" She squints. \"That doesn't seem like something you'd do...\"\n\nMara smiles faintly. \"No.\"\n\n\n27.\n\nThey have several more conversations.\n\nThe revelations are absolute in their terror.

They let him pick his detail and negotiate his salary.\n\nOrin's case is not so simple. She is not who she was, so after vigorous philosophical debate, it is decreed that she cannot be held accountable for her past oaths. But she engaged in witting trespass, aided and abetted by a learned civilian, and for that, she must sacrifice a boon: an unnamed future debt of the crown's choosing.\n\nOrin accepts the sentence gladly and returns to Earth to mend her wounds.

Half of us want to restrain the Ghosts of the Vanguard and the Drifter all at once, and have them face Praxic justice. But that would shatter the peace in the City, irreparably.\n\nMeanwhile, the Shadows of Yor continue to have a presence in this City. And no Golden Gun in sight to contain them. The Man must be busy.\n\nIt seems the fate of this town rests on your shoulders once again. The choices you make in the coming weeks could affect more lives than any bullet you've ever fired. Consider that.\n\nAnd consider this:\n\nThe Drifter is polluting minds, driving Guardians away from what he nebulously calls the \"Traveler's dogma.\" He's turned a lot of minds onto the idea that Darkness is a tool worth using.\n\nThis City was built on a foundation of fighting the Darkness and everything it stands for: the erasure of order, individual empowerment over the common good. The Hive and the Taken live to serve their gods. The Traveler empowers humanity to live.\n\nHe says otherwise, but the Drifter is not above systems. That armor he's offering you in his so-called \"Reckoning\" represents a choice in a system of his making. He's just here to disrupt the natural order for personal gain, and he doesn't care who dies for it.\n\nThe Vanguard is relying on you more than ever. Against the Drifter. Against themselves.\n\nYou'll know what to do.\n\nI have Dredgens to hunt.","name":"Message from Aunor V","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/d2d41d201c1932f5fc45337876be7495.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"","hash":4041567599,"index":975,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"4041567596":{"displayProperties":{"description":"You compose an encrypted message to Aunor of the Praxic Order.

You've got good instincts.\n\nSeems to me that the Drifter's picked himself a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Probably another young war hero, like you. If he's writing down his \"lessons,\" maybe he'll write down the one scrap of truth that we need to nail him to the wall. Chase the rest of those \"tapes.\"\n\nIn the meantime, I followed up with my colleagues about the Nine. Used to be that every couple years or so, somebody would get to talking to X\u00fbr, then they'd decide that they were going to be the great mind to crack the mystery of the Nine. Go off to find them. Bunch of Cryptarchs, mostly. A couple Guardians. Then the Light went out during the Red War, and one last ambitious mind went out in search of providence: a Sunbreaker by the name of Orin.\n\nShe came back as the Emissary. Set up the Trials, said the Nine were standing ready to judge the worthiest among us\u2014for what, we don't know. Seems they like strong warriors. The disappearances have stopped since then. I should note here that a couple people called those disappearances \"abductions.\"\n\nWord of advice? Try to keep emotional language out of your reports.\n\nTo the knowledge of the Praxic Order, the Nine aren't allies of the Darkness. We've got solid intel from Reef spies that the Awoken Queen's working with them now beyond the system. Could be that they're up to no good, but\u2014whatever's out there is apparently more important than all that suffering in the Dreaming City, and every Corsair I've talked to believes that through and through. I believe their belief. The Awoken have too much self-respect to live under a bad leader. Bad's different than popular, of course.\n\nAnyway, I don't think the Nine or their Emissary intend to harm you\u2014not right now, at least. It'd be helpful if we knew what they wanted with Drifter, but... That investigation is up to you.

Behind them, an ashen silhouette smoldered on the cliffside.\n\n\"I gave you every chance,\" said the man with the Golden Gun. \"Any last words?\"\n\nOne hostage lifted his head and took a breath. Before he could speak, his skull erupted in a bloom of Arc Light. A Void arrow lanced through the air and lodged in the throat of the second hostage. He slumped over, falling against his dead companion.\n\nThe man turned to look in the direction of the shots. The Golden Gun blazed bright in his fist.\n\nThe Ghosts of the dead Guardians materialized to resurrect their fallen charges\u2014but were cut short as two restraining bands whistled through the trees and snapped across their frames.\n\nThe Ghosts fell, enervated by Arc pulses flowing from their restraints.\n\nLoose pebbles murmured down the cliffside as six Warlocks dressed in black dusters entered the camp single-file. They all carried Quitclaim shotguns.\n\nThe man did not move.\n\nThe woman leading the Warlocks stepped closer to the man. She held out a Cormorant Seal, fearless in the light of his ever-burning Gun. \"Aunor.

Aunor racked the Quitclaim. Her Warlocks followed her lead.\n\nThe man stood. \"Shaxx wouldn't like it if you all came home in pieces. Take them. I'll be watching. They so much as breathe wrong and they're mine.\"\n\nHe walked into the forest, fist still aflame.

They had somehow gotten their hands on restraint tech\u2014Praxic tech.\n\nShe'd have to follow up on that some time. If she lived.\n\nNo Man with a Golden Gun. No fireteam. No backup.\n\nShe had been chasing a lead on a group of new-blood Dredgens, taking her Sparrow over Veridian Bridge to a local Gensym lab. But the Shadows were waiting for her.\n\nFrom a hidden vantage point on an overpass above, a single rocket from a shoulder-mounted launcher had obliterated the road in front of her. She'd been thrown straight off her machine.\n\nIn that split second, she saw Bahaghari had tried to catch her in a beam of Light, but with a telltale whistle and snap, a restraining band had silenced her Ghost. She was falling by then.\n\nShe leaned into the roaring wind, transitioned her fall into a dive. The impact and temperature of the water shocked and chilled her to the bone as debris rained into the lake around her.\n\nShe started the long swim toward shore, toward a road she knew would take her to the overpass.\n\n**\n\nShe pulled up onto the overpass on a hijacked Pike and looked down at the smoldering wreckage of the bridge where she had fallen an hour ago. Bahaghari was nowhere in sight, but her helmet's visor picked up an echo of Void discharge from a sniper's vantage. It was consistent with the launch pattern of a shoulder-mounted Countess SA\/2.\n\nShe patched it back to Drifter, and in return, he gave her the coordinates of three possible Shadow safehouses in the area. Without Bahaghari, she had to input them manually to her tracker HUD.\n\nShe selected the farthest one from her position and gunned the Pike.\n\n**\n\nBy the time she pulled up to an abandoned warehouse in District 125, the Shadows had already ransomed her Ghost on several City bands. They wanted clearance to take their jumpships out of the system by midnight. Without clearance, they'd kill Bahaghari.\n\nThe Vanguard ignored the missive entirely. Renegades were not to be negotiated with. Not even Osiris himself. And these Shadows were no Osiris.\n\nThe maglev train coming from Core East roared on a rail above. The next train would arrive at midnight.\n\nShe could see a light on the top floor of the rust-red building, and the silhouettes of several people.\n\n\"I'm not on that floor,\" Bahaghari said. Aunor started.\n\n\"How\u2014\"\n\n\"I hacked the restraint. It's Praxic tech. We've got a renegade in the Order.\"\n\n\"Worry about that later. You said you're not on the top floor?\"\n\n\"No. The basement. Under the street. Building's empty except for us. Don't even think about a breach, you'll need a team. Or a Gjallarhorn.\"\n\n\"Don't have either, Bighari.\"\n\n\"Don't even think about it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything.\"\n\n\"You never call me that unless you're about to do something stupid.\"\n\n**\n\nShe had never driven a maglev train before. She liked the feel of power in the front car, watching the world hurtle past.\n\nThe train was empty. She had ordered all the passengers and the conductor off before she'd requisitioned it. You could convince people to do almost anything with a Cormorant Seal.\n\nThe turn came rushing up, and she keyed a control on her wrist.\n\nA series of proximity mines on the rail and the barrier that supported it exploded, and the train hurtled forward through the smoke and fire\u2014\n\nDown onto a rust-red warehouse building far below.\n\n**\n\nShe could see everything Bahaghari could see, even in death.\n\nFor those inside the building, it was like the world was ending.\n\nBut her Ghost was free, heading straight for the front car of the train that had impaled the upper floor of the warehouse. A pair of injured Shadows, the only survivors, were right behind her as she came up to Aunor's slumped body, her eye blazing with Light.\n\nAunor emerged from a radiant column and ducked under the bleeding Shadow's haymaker, slamming a blazing palm into his gut. She burned straight through him and rolled forward on the momentum, under a thundering shot from the second Shadow's hand cannon.\n\nShe transitioned the roll into a stiff sidekick from the ground, shattering the man's unarmored knee. She mounted him as he fell and bludgeoned him unconscious with a rain of burning elbows.\n\nBahaghari came up behind her. \"There are three more bodies... somewhere under this train. What now?\"\n\nAunor stood up, covered in blood and ash.\n\n\"We take their Ghosts. Alert the Vanguard. We have five renegades in custody.\"\n\nAunor found her duster in the train cab, tattered and badly burnt. She put it on, clasped her Cormorant Seal in place, and sat next to the bodies, waiting for her prisoners' Ghosts to materialize.\n\nHer radio clicked.\n\n\"No casualties. You did well,\" Ikora said.\n\n\"Are you speaking as the head of the Warlocks or the head of the Hidden?\" Aunor returned.\n\n\"As your friend. You slipped, but you saved it. Zavala and I appreciate your help in this. It's imperative\u2014\"\n\n\"That Drifter and Gambit continue, yes.\"\n\n\"Aunor.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are we good? We're asking a lot of you.\"\n\n\"I don't ever want your job. And the City needs that rat man's connections and his means. If he can bring Orin back to us...\"\n\n\"Mm.

They welcome him into their lean little camp. They feed him: clean water, unseasoned rabbit, a tiny dipper of honey. They entertain him: rumors, jokes, an epic that takes more than an hour and a half to tell.

This is why I shared my truths with you\u2014my journey, the Shadows, our purpose, our sins. When you sought Thorn, the hated yin to the Word's noble yang, I knew you were headed in a fateful direction that would see me and mine as nothing more than afterthoughts in the wars to come. That I may have served as a catalyst for even a sliver of your continued growth is an honor. All of my faith says you will be a linchpin in the building of a new world, one where absolutes cower to the might of compromise, where Light tempers dark and the dark opens new insight into the Light's many undiscovered gifts.\n\nFrom this moment on, my closest allies and I will be gone. Our job is done. And, despite appearances, our purest intent was never as simple and mundane as to rile and endanger, though such tactics were needed. No, our task was always to find those, like yourself, who could further the meaning of what it means to be a Guardian and to push you forward in ways never before considered or allowed.\n\nPart of me worries that you will hold some level of contempt for the manner in which I have chosen to work. The Vanguard certainly do, and they do not endorse it, though they abide it. They don't know everything the Shadows and I have done. It is better that they do not.\n\nBut know this\u2014as clearly as you know anything\u2014the means justify the ends and there is no part of me that regrets the choices I've made. The circumstances that have led us all here? Yes. There is a pain at the very heart of me that any of us must exist in this terrible world we have, in part crafted for ourselves, but know above all things: It is our enemies, those who have come from out of the black to hinder our every advance, who deserve our ire.

Nor was it when we followed his path and resurrected our own diseased replicas of Thorn. The first whisper was on the Ridge, standing over his body. Just before I released the final two sun-baked charges into his limp, motionless body, there was a faint calling\u2014wicked words in a hateful tongue.

One day the Leviathan howls along at speed, and the next it drifts on an idle course. We still cannot repair the butchered control systems, and our Emperor, who once ordered this ship's construction for his purposes, refuses to share his knowledge in metaconcert.\n\nYet as we leave the space that was once his dominion, I see how my Emperor digests his situation. He no longer rages and spills wine. He has not cursed Ghaul's name in nearly a year. I feel his thoughts taking new shape and color.\n\nI do not know if I like it.\n\nIn the fast-time of relativity, we watch the Cabal change around us, and it leaves my eye cold from weeping. When Calus reigned, artists and thinkers visited the athenaeum worlds to be inspired by alien wonders from across and beyond the Cabal. Now the athenaeum worlds are shut. The works they inspired have been replaced by grim assembly-line weapons and the architecture of bunkers. Fountains geyser black fuel; gardens vanish beneath belching factoria.\n\nGhaul has even disfigured the peoples' minds. He has dismembered the Cabal of its foreign influences, teaching the people a pit fighter's gruesome self-sufficiency. Weapons only a grunt can understand. Language that can only be barked through a battlenet. I mourn the empire that built wonders like the Ninth Bridge. I mourn all the client species beaten into cogs.\n\nBut if I mourn, my Emperor withers entirely. Even his interest in the archives and the observatory has vanished\u2014he no longer cares to study a universe that has offended him. He doubts his own divinity, because how could a god allow this to happen? His rage has gone and he does not know what he has left after it.

My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe are at war. Here at the fringe of the empire, fleets clash over emptiness. In council, we surmise that the tyrant Ghaul wants this void as a buffer against invasion\u2014but isn't the irony bitter? This enemy desires nothing but our death. And so we oblige them by dying for nothing.\n\nIt is the opposite of everything Calus wanted for his people. Even the new Cabal's ships are expendable. These are not the beautiful deterrents of Calus's armada; they are ugly, hasty, and crude. The crews live in their armor, prisoners of their duty, escaping only through music and games smuggled into the battlenet. One popular pastime, I understand, is to draft personal \"fleets\" and \"legions\" from among real Cabal ships and soldiers, competing with comrades to win the most victories. Of course it is very bad luck to draft your own unit.\n\nThe enemy is yet worse. All Psions live in a world of minds. I believe in the cup and all its spirits because I feel those spirits every day\u2014the prints left by other minds on the things I touch and see. These Hive... have no spirit. Their souls are emaciated. Some horrible solvent has stripped them of everything but hate, cunning, and the will to survive. I think they worship death because it is the only salvation from their existence.\n\nI suggested that the War Councilors invite Calus to observe one of Ghaul's carrier groups attacking a Hive war moon. He came because he knows the value of pretending to care. But even the shape of the fleet hurt him; Ghaul and his tyrannical ally Umun'arath have abandoned proud, independent cruisers (instruments of state, Calus liked to say) for swarms of frigates that suckle fuel from enormous fleet carriers. The Hive's portals leave no time or space for elegant vector dances, so these new ships are built for brutal exchanges at point-blank range.\n\nWe felt other Psions at work, hiding the traitor fleet from the Hive as they scattered drills and boarding pods in the war moon's path. A strike at the surface was not enough; someone would have to bring a planet-cracker warhead down into the moon's viscera. Caught up in the excitement, I asked one of the war councilors how we could possibly prevail against the Hive, who were so old and so powerful.\n\nShe compared our Cabal to a seagoing warship and the Hive to a submarine. They might dive into deep metaphysical layers of existence, where we are no match for them. But in the ordinary universe, the Hive are like a submarine on the surface: still dangerous, but not invincibly so.\n\nI was fascinated and secretly struck by the clarity of the goblet on her face. Did she believe we could ultimately defeat the Hive?\n\nNo, she said. But we could hold them back long enough to live our lives. Wasn't that enough?\n\nInviting Calus was a mistake. It only reminded him that he had no power at all.","name":"Entry II","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"Entry II","hash":1489617035,"index":1078,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1489617034":{"displayProperties":{"description":"By the mind of Match.

The astronomers say that an ancient cataclysm blasted open an abscess in the cosmos here. I feel the absence of spirits like a pressure headache, as if everything inside me wants to come rushing out.\n\nWe are all losing hope, but as long as we are still losing it, then it has not run out. Psions are said to have no sense of humor, because humor comes from the unexpected, and we are clairvoyant. Well, we were not clairvoyant enough to expect the coup, so I suppose we must be blind enough to retain a sense of humor, and I can still laugh at our predicament: the loyal retinue of the Curious Emperor, the Emperor of Joyous Excess, marooned in absolute nothingness.\n\nCalus won't leave his observation couch\u2014not to take meals, not to visit gardens or sample the wines, not to read or to write in his Imperativa Titanica or to suggest new dishes to the cooks or to tell us stories from far-away worlds or even to wonder aloud why Caiatl never heeded him.

My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nI was in the observatory today when he came to me. I should have been vetting a list of loyalists for the countercoup, but in truth, I was watching the ruined mirrors of an ancient starshell as they plummeted four hundred million kilometers into a blue sun. They look like crumpled handkerchiefs. Their fall is very slow, and those who made them are eons dead.\n\nHere on our Leviathan, all is reborn. The guard companies have buffed their armor to a syrupy shine. The ship responds ably to our commands, and we can barely quench its appetite for mass to feed its engines and factories. Music fills the gardens, the gardeners hum along as they trim and weed, and Calus dallies in the kitchens with a pinch of spice, once more unmistakably himself.\n\nI haven't thought into this journal since that day at the edge, when Calus came out of his observation bubble overflowing with joy. \"It's the end,\" he bellowed, giddy as a girl with her first tusks. \"It's magnificent, it's divine, it's more than I ever was! Match, it's the end of everything!\"\n\nHe frightened me. That day frightened all of us\u2014none of us will speak of it, and we do not dare more than the shallowest metaconcert, lest our memories pool into a deadly truth. But in that void, Calus saw his purpose renewed. He guided us to reset the failed navigation system, repair the traitors' sabotage, and retake control. I thought we would hurry back to the homeworld, but Calus no longer seems to pine for his lost throne... or to care at all about the reforms he once championed.\n\nNow we wander the galaxy on an epicurean crusade, sampling a bounty of raw furies and rare delights. All the inquisitiveness and avarice that Calus once poured into government he now extends to his appetites. I have seen Calus feast on things no living mouth can eat. A chill superfluid of helium-4, whorled in his cup for ten years by a single turn of his wrist: he returned a decade later to toss it back. Or a pea of neutronium that should have torn through him like fog. He told me it tasted like the thickest fudge.\n\nHe is changing.\n\nHe was here a moment ago. The ruined starshell caught his attention: He loves beauty, and millions of mirror-bright sails folding up like tissues in wind to fall into a blue giant are very beautiful. Eons ago, someone built these mirrors to hover on the blue star's light, and for a while, I suppose, they lived in sun-fed paradise.\n\n\"How did they die?\" I asked.\n\n\"That, Match, is the wrong question.\" He tuned the observation room to track a single tumbling mirror. In life, the sail had been as wide as the space between a world and its moon; in death, the rigging had collapsed into a thistle of spinmetal and glint. \"What you should ask is why I am so glad they died!\"\n\nI could not imagine, and I admitted it. \"These beings were much like us. They did not travel through time or lacerate the universe and crawl into the wounds or yearn for the patronage of any old machine... they were creatures of material ambition, of physics, of life. If they failed, it is an omen of death for us.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Calus said, with wry generosity. \"They were grand once. They thought, very briefly, that they would live forever. And they were wrong. We would be very ungrateful to refuse the lesson, wouldn't we?\"\n\nI sat before a fountain and tried to pour out the spirits for guidance, but they would not explain.\n\n(An addendum, later: I have not seen Calus in the flesh since.)","name":"Entry V","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"Entry V","hash":1489617036,"index":1081,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1489617039":{"displayProperties":{"description":"By the mind of Match, Shadow Councilor to the True Emperor. Upon the Leviathan, triumphant in our Emperor's battle. Today I fill the Y-goblet with linen, so that my ancestors may tie up their wounds. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe have conquered the Clipse.\n\nAmong all the clients of Calus's reign, all those diverse species he encouraged to join and influence our great culture, the Clipse were one of his dearest favorites. When they greeted his return with missiles, it wounded him terribly. But Calus neither sulked nor raged nor signaled them in the dead of their night to woefully demand an explanation. This I credit to his mysterious new philosophy.\n\nInstead, he asked Valus Nohr to plan and execute the reconquest of the Clipse, using only the Leviathan and the troops aboard. Then he asked me to deliver an account of Clipse history since the coup.\n\nCalus was proud of his aid to the Clipse. They are\u2014were\u2014trapped in endless war with their alien-infested biosphere, which spawns horrors wherever it grows. Calus saw this war as a regrettable but unalterable fact, so instead of military support, he sought to enrich the Clipse with fine culture and high luxury. The Clipse were not pleased. After Ghaul's mutiny, the Dominus tried to secure their loyalty by sending a fleet group to \"win\" their ancient war.\n\nOf course, the legionaries discovered it was impossible to conquer the xenocidal ecosystem without destroying the planet itself. Their efforts only poisoned the Clipse, both world and people. After a century of botched climate engineering, toxic shock attacks, and \"clear and hold\" nonsense, Ghaul wrote off the tormented Clipse as \"no longer essential to the strategic security of the empire.\"\n\nI think the Clipse hoped they could win back Ghaul's favor by defying Calus. Perhaps they thought their world was unconquerable. Perhaps they were even right, in the end. Valus Nohr landed on their moon and military capital Kaga-Clipse with just six thousand troops. For eight weeks, the Clipse attacked her by ground and by orbit as their robotic interceptors swarmed the Leviathan. I was not part of the great metaconcert that helped protect us, but the might of gathered minds filled the carpets with static and gave me constant d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nWhen Nohr broke out of her bastion on her famous thunder run, calling down the Leviathan's missiles on the vital command posts she'd identified, the Clipse defense crumbled. Their last desperate act was a commando strike at the Leviathan itself. The boarding craft slipped under our sensors, but the metaconcert felt the vengeful purpose aboard.\n\nCalus stopped us from firing. \"I welcome their attempt,\" he said. \"Let me see their spirit.\"\n\nI called to ask his intentions\u2014I have not seen him face to face for longer than I can count. \"I'm curating my followers, Match,\" he answered. \"Thinking about the shadows I'll cast.\"\n\nThe Clipse attack failed, of course, but there was a survivor\u2014the one named Rull. Some think he earned a face-to-face meeting with Calus, though I doubt it was truly His Face. With Kaga-Clipse in our control, we could destroy the Clipse world at our leisure. Calus rewarded their surrender by giving Rull a gift: everything the Clipse needed to end their agonizing perpetual war.\n\nIt was a sheet of paper, the thick rough-edged sort that Calus makes out of cometary water and cotton from his personal garden (he says that he likes the smell). Rull signed it after two hours in a room with Calus. The Leviathan's factories shuddered into motion, forging luxurious self-contained arcologies, pocket worlds that could hold thousands in perpetual comfort.\n\nWhen Rull's chosen people were safe in the arcologies, the guns of Kaga-Clipse bombarded the Clipse homeworld into a global firestorm. The chosen survivors in the arcologies would inherit lives of plenty. The rest had the peace of ash. The eternal war was over.\n\nI prayed to the cup in the mirror for answers. But it was Calus who responded.\n\n\"Match.\" He spoke into my mind just as a Psion would. \"I told Rull the truth. Everything is going to end soon. We must accept that. What matters is the joy and companionship we can find before the final moment. Why let billions suffer for a future that will never come? Life with no dignity and no purpose except to go on living isn't life. It's a virus. It's a curse. Better to die than to become like the Hive.\"\n\nRull left his world to journey with us. I wonder if he could not face what he'd done.","name":"Entry VI","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"Entry VI","hash":1489617039,"index":1082,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1489617038":{"displayProperties":{"description":"By the mind of Match, Shadow Councilor to the True Emperor.

Why would some be happy, and others miserable?\"\n\n\"Perhaps they had more metal,\" I suggested, dryly.\n\n\"Exactly!\" He clapped in delight, nearly bowling me over. \"Happiness is comparative, Match. I tell you that if a rich man lived next to a woman who had ten times his wealth, he would never be satisfied, even in marriage. He would feel poor when he looked at her. Even the basic satisfactions of our biology require contrast\u2014the absence of thirst, the absence of hunger, the absence of loneliness.\"\n\n\"This is a child's philosophy, your Majesty,\" I protested. \"We need pain to know pleasure? We need loss to make us treasure gain? A runt would say these things. Why, you once told me that these are homilies the miserable use to excuse their misery. Suffering does not heighten happiness. Fear does not bless us. True contentment is true in itself.\"\n\nHe looked at me with great satisfaction, delighted by my insight, and by the way my words reflected his own wisdom. \"What was the flaw in my empire, Match? Why did Ghaul overthrow me?\"\n\nI sensed he did not want my first answer: because those disenfranchised and infuriated by his cosmopolitan reforms had united without his knowledge. \"Because you did not fear death, your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Exactly! I opened my arms to embrace all my peoples, offering them consumption without limit and celebration without end. The stars themselves burned sweet and clear, and I forgot\u2014even stars die.\" He leaned closer to me. I felt warmth like an oven under his counterfeit skin. \"You're right. The truly happy do not need misery and suffering to give their lives meaning. They exist in the moment, at peace with their inevitable death. Now that I've accepted all this will end... it has meaning again, Match! I have MORE than the rest of the universe. I've seen what's coming! I know the value of every moment left!\"\n\nHe smiled at me, his cleft pulled back from bright teeth. \"And I want you to value those moments too, Match. I wonder... if there is something you want to tell me. Something that would change the rest of your life. Make no mistake: an end is coming, soon, and you will have no chance at all afterwards to correct what you regret. So why delay?

How could I betray him, in this time of endings, by keeping a secret he has asked to share?\n\nI went to him as he bathed in his royal pool, for his proxies are, of course, as exquisitely sensual as his old form. I shed my garments, there being no more taboo between us than between two animals, and sat beside him in the glow of his comfort.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" I said, \"I kept a secret from you.\"\n\nI explained how I worshipped my ancestors and the sacred chalice that cupped their spirits. I admitted that I had put these beliefs before him in my heart. He listened as I told him how the ancient God-Thoughts of my people, the operant overlords who dominated our prehistory by sheer mental penetration, had exterminated my faith for daring to see a spark of the divine in every common person.\n\n\"Match,\" he said, \"you have committed a crime, and I will pass my sentence shortly. But first, let me ask you something. Do you think I made the right choice with the Clipse?\"\n\n\"No,\" I admitted.\n\n\"Because I ended so many lives?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Majesty.\"\n\n\"But knowing that they would soon end anyway, and that by killing most I could allow a small few to live in happiness rather than in strife... did I not choose the greatest possible good?\"\n\n\"I suppose, your Majesty, that my faith makes me see the shared suffering of the Clipse as... more fair than the survival of a happy few. If I were one of the Clipse, I would want a fair chance. Not judgment from on high.\"\n\nHe nodded in compassion. \"I know. I once tried to be fair too, Match. An empire of excess for every citizen, no matter their class or species of birth. It is good for a ruler to raise the standard by which his subjects live. But what if that ruler has found proof, absolute proof, that existence is a zero-sum game? That there is not enough time or energy to give everyone a fair life? Knowing that, mustn't we privilege a chosen few?\"\n\nI did not know and I admitted it.\n\n\"That's all right. I don't ask certainty.\" He shifted himself, sending waves across the pool. \"For a long time after the coup, I stared out into the infinite universe, and I saw... meaninglessness. In a universe that goes on forever, there must be an infinity of Caluses, all staring at the same blankness. How could I be a god if I was... generic?\n\n\"But now that I have seen what is coming, now that there is a limit to the time afforded to us... well, it may sound cruel, Match, but the less there is of everything else, the more I matter. I intend to be the last good thing in this world. I will gather my chosen companions and ease as much suffering as I can before the end. There are emperors who would take on any shape to escape death. I am not one. I am true to myself. And so, Match, are you.\"\n\nHe clapped me on the back with enormous gentleness. \"Your only crime, my councilor, was that you denied me the chance to give you a gift. Come. Show me the place you favor, and tell me the measurements you require. I will build you a temple so you can worship without fear. And all I ask is that you remember me in your prayers.\"","name":"Entry VIII","icon":"\/common\/destiny2_content\/icons\/92904fbbef5bcc82030dd818c60d49af.png","hasIcon":true},"subtitle":"Entry VIII","hash":1489617025,"index":1084,"redacted":false,"blacklisted":false},"1489617024":{"displayProperties":{"description":"By the mind of Match, Shadow Councilor to the True Emperor.

He loves the great heroic sulks so many of them enter when they become dissatisfied with their work.

And out of the Nothing, there came whispering in a dark language, which filled his head so loud that he forgot for a moment his own language, and suddenly the Nothingness dispersed to show Something, which was a fleet of foreign ships. He saw next the destruction of a great many worlds and creatures, including all his enemies, and himself, and he saw the rot and fragmentation of his own corpse and skeleton.

This planet, being a repository for precious, ancient knowledge collected by the Emperor, was chosen for its hostile environment, which served as a built-in defense system for intruders and thieves.\n\nEn route to the planet's Inner Sanctum, where the athenaeum world's knowledge was kept, the Shadows were stalked by an undocumented species of indigenous wildlife, whose natural capabilities as a predator proved unexpectedly debilitating to the companion-soul of the Shadow of Earth. The Shadow, being symbiotically reliant on its companion-soul, was thus weakened and the trio was forced to bivouac in place beneath a great monolith as a storm fell upon them.\n\nThe creatures, who so far had lurked at the edges of the party's vision, crept closer under cover of the storm, which grew ever stronger, and executed a stealth attack. Thus began a bloody battle, wherein the three Shadows fought back half a dozen creatures with modest success, and wherein the Shadow of the Eliksni fell in combat.

A great many of the Leviathan's inhabitants were filled with dread and fright. [While this coward invents his histories and futures, I wait. These messages are my gift to you.]\n\nBut the great Emperor Calus had seen Death at the edge of the universe and was not afraid, for this witch and her spawn were not Death.\n\nSaid the laughing Emperor to his beloved Shadow of Earth:\n\n\"Remove the wretched Savath\u00fbn from my hallways. I have no use for her or her children. So consumed are they by their tragic hunger, the Hive would cast a weak Shadow. Erase them from that great horizon that awaits us, for they have no place at my table when the end comes.\"\n\nAnd so the Shadow of Earth exterminated the children of Savath\u00fbn. When the mother herself sought to slither back into the hole from whence she'd come, the Shadow of Earth followed her to her throne and slew her there, to die her final death.^\n\n\n\n^A note to Scribe Shagac: Please be advised that, although our great Emperor knows the shape of the future very well, we cannot presume its texture. Refrain from making such sweeping, grandiose assumptions about unknowable technologies, like those of the athenaeum worlds. It will save us a great deal of rewriting later.

There was a great rejoicing, for the struggle to evade the sharp edge of the end of the world was over, and the people of this System could at last breathe, and live, and love, in the shadow of their ever-present doom.\n\nNow royal wine flows freely for the friends of the Emperor, and the planetoid of Nessus has its eternal home at the Emperor's table, forever immortalized as a symbol of celebration.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the War Machine Rasputin, the Shadow of Earth recreated the region of Hellas Basin into a monument to the might and beauty of the great Emperor Calus. The unsightly \"BrayTech Futurescape\" was demolished and remade into the Temple of Revelry, where all in the System come to celebrate the accomplishments of the great Emperor, and the blemished red sands of Mars were reformed into a vast sulphurous mudflat, suitable for wallowing at leisure.\n\nOn Earth, Humanity celebrates the Feast of Emperor Calus, a day of jubilation and thanksgiving.

His description is indeed what came to pass, and is happening now, 118 years after the Emperor brought liberty to the Sol system.\n\nFirst, a veil of darkness descended on all the worlds of this universe, such that the people of these worlds looked into the sky and saw only night. All worlds, no matter their natural or synthetic geographies or climate, grew cold. The people of these worlds, having been subjected to this strangeness and adversity, began to grow afraid and suspicious of one another. Many deaths occurred in this intervening time before the end.\n\nNext, a great war broke out across all varieties of civilization, be they naturally war-minded or peaceful. This warring, which goes on even now, is due to a futile desire to postpone the end of things when no such deferment can possibly occur; as such, the civilizations of the Sol system do not partake, for they accept the coming end as shown to them by their beloved Emperor. Even so, these good creatures are not exempt from the miserable clawing of others, who thrash blindly against the inevitable end.\n\nBut, we know from the words of the Great Emperor, the suffering will end. Death will soon arrive to the universe, and claim all of it for Itself. This will be the end of everything: all living things and non-living things, all that is real or theoretical.\n\nThe last to see it, to see Death as It consumes everything in this world, will be the great Emperor himself.\n\n\n\n+The scribe employed at this future date shall adjust the name mentioned here, should I, Scribe Ixolt, expire before the publication of this record.

I do not wish it away, no, but I am faced with accepting that ushering in the blessed, long-awaited end means an ultimate goodbye to you. Old friend.\n\nYou and I were always connected. The threads of fate strung us together and tightened, drawing us ever closer, however slowly\u2014and I realize now that, even before we found each other, you were a presence in my life. Time is such a strange, twisting thing, and I see my past so differently.\n\nWhen I was alone in the prison-room of the Leviathan, you were there, as well, building my Menagerie. Creating a monument to all that we could, and would, do.\n\nWhen I met the void, you were there, somewhere in those phantom whispers, my companion in bringing forth the inevitable end of the world.\n\nEven before I knew you, I searched for you. I was searching for you when I found my first Shadows. I was mourning your absence when they failed. And yes, my Shadow, the search was exquisite. The wait was bliss. But the moment I found you, the completion of my design... It was pure delight.\n\nYou helped me reclaim what was lost when the Empire fell to the Red Legion. More than that\u2014you helped me build beyond it. We took this System together. Together, we created a new world, in the mere moments before it ended.
